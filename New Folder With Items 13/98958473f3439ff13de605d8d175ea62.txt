<p>Are you awesome?</p>
<p>NGI, an established (37 years) B2B news/data services company, located in Dulles, Virginia, is looking for a hands-on professional, experienced in both inside and outside business development and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Because of the growth in demand for B2B energy news and data, and as a result of a few smart and/or lucky decisions we have made along the way, NGI has experienced tremendous growth in web content and traffic. Help us continue to monetize that growth.</p>
<p>There is no cold calling here - we promise. Our name recognition, marketing and content spawn lots of warm, inbound leads. You will help these folks figure out if NGI's B2B products and services are right for them.</p>
<p>There will also be some travel to cities such as Chicago, Houston, Boston and Denver, LA and Mexico City. We will send you to conferences (maybe once a month at most) in these and other terrible places and encourage you to make friends with folks in the industry. If these friends then become NGI customers, that is a good thing and you will be benefited both financially and through (we hope) a sense of accomplishment!</p>
<p>We also have lots of existing customers we would like to keep. You will provide first touch, white-glove customer service (think inbound chat, email and phone) to these good folks. Again, if they like you and us, then they are more likely to remain our customer and maybe they will even buy additional products and services from us.</p>

<ul>
<li>High emotional IQ, exquisite communication skills and relentless work ethic - these are a must!</li>
<li>B2B sales experience required. Subscription sales a bonus</li>
<li>Extraordinary verbal and written communications skills</li>
<li>High digital IQ. Quick to learn new software/apps/tech</li>
<li>Motivation to take responsibility and commitment to get the job done</li>

<ul>
<li>Fully comp'd benefits: health, dental, vision, 401k, Starbucks coffee and snacks.</li>
<li>Flexible hours, Bike to work (just off the W&amp;OD Bike trail), Work from home; Just get the job done.</li>
<li>An agile (~25 employees), 37-year old energy information provider who punches above its weight.</li>
