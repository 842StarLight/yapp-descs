<h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>
Work Smart. Work Creatively. Work with Us.</b></h2>
<p>Together, we work hard, work smart, and have fun. After all – it isn’t just “work” if you love what you do. Step inside and see for yourself.</p>
<p>
Awesome Work Space. We moved in 2017 to an office that has an abundance of windows, meeting space, and upgraded appliances! We have plenty of room to grow in our new and updated space.</p>
<p>
401(k) Savings Plan. Because we all dream of that moment we can finally sit back and put our feet up.</p>
<p>
Healthcare &amp; Benefits. If you have your health, you have everything. And we want you to always be on your A-game.</p>
<p>
Short-Term Disability. We understand that sometimes, life gets in the way and things beyond work take priority. Short-term disability allows you to focus on you, so you can be your best self inside and outside of the office.</p>
<p>
Competitive PTO. Find a work-life balance that allows you to make time for yourself and the things that excite you in your free time. We also have 8 national holidays off per year.</p>
<p>
Opportunities to Attend Industry Events. Ongoing education is important to keep our team ahead of the curve, so we take advantage of industry events, seminars, and conferences when they present themselves.</p>
<p>
Team Activities &amp; Outings. Work hard, play hard is an attitude that can be expected. We would argue laughter is a great exercise… and mental health is important. So is team bonding.</p>
