<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>
Twitter is accelerating the growth of our advertising business and we’re looking for a strong senior Product Manager to join our talented team to lead our transparency products. Our transparency products provide transparency on the promoted content that runs our platform in order to build trust with Twitter users, deliver on our external commitments to transparency, and reduce the risk of bad actors on our advertising platform. You will be responsible for driving the vision, product strategy, and execution of Twitter’s ads transparency initiative.</p>

<li>
Frequently consult stakeholders in public policy, data protection, ads policy, external comms and product counsel, given the often sensitive and public-facing product work that you will ship.</li>
<li>
Own and deliver success on business goals for Ads Transparency by developing a compelling product vision and executing on it.</li>
<li>
Be a change agent and thought leader, working with leaders throughout the industry representing Twitter.</li>
<li>

<li>
Orchestrate product development work outside of your core EPDR team, when necessary, by achieving cross-functional buy-in.</li>
<li>
Synthesize insights from user research, customer meetings, usage data, and sales feedback to prioritize improvements and new feature ideas that will deliver business objectives and customer benefits.</li>
<li>
Develop methods for assessing product and project success, and processes to increase the likelihood of it.</li>
