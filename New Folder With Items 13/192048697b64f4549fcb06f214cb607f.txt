<h2>Real Estate Outside Sales Agent</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>My name is Michael Szakos and right now, as my team is growing, I am in need of quality, licensed Real Estate Agents to work with some of our buyers and sellers. I am trying to dedicate more time to building and expanding my business, so I need to spend less time being directly involved with transactions in order for this to happen. I don't require the Agents on my team to make cold calls, door knock, or pay for any advertising or lead generation. All they have to do is complete my high level master training program, then be available for appointments that are set for them by my inside sales staff, and then meet with those buyers and sellers (using our prebuilt presentations of value). There's also opportunity for my Agents to call their own assigned prospects and set up their own buyer and seller appointments for themselves, should they want even more business.
</p>
<p>I am looking for <b>special</b> individuals to help us achieve our goals - those who have a passion for helping people and gaining personal growth. We receive between 200 - 250 new prospects per month, and are not currently able to handle all of our growing lead flow.
</p>
<p>My Agents currently get 1-2 appointments per week assigned to them. The less involved I can be within transactions, the more appointments I can set for my Agents, so that number is rising.
</p>
<p>We are a high producing, fun team to work with, and we allow each team member to just focus on what (s)he does best, whether it's paperwork, marketing, or selling. We are ramping things up to be an amazing 2019. You can make $75,000 - $100,000+ just in the first year, with no cold calling, no grunt prospecting, no desk fees or monthly fees, appointments provided for you from our high producing Inside Sales team, and admin support provided for you. This is truly a life-changing career decision.
</p>
<p>This opportunity is intended for individuals who want to be part of a team, use our proven systems, get free coaching, mentorship, and who want to earn a lot more money and help a lot more people.
</p>
<p>I have two spots to add to my team right now. Your inquiry will be held in the strictest confidence and your present broker/employer will not be contacted.
