<p><b>About Live Objects</b></p>
<p>
Live Objects delivers continuous business process optimizations to the enterprise through AI-driven automation of discovery, design and process engineering by mining patterns in business objects, cases and transactions across all process variations. The product integrates deeply with business process management platforms (like SAP, Salesforce etc.) and delivers continuous process engineering natively as on-demand compositions through the platform’s interfaces. Live Objects’ path-breaking process-calculus engine models predictive, diagnostic and quality related projections for live cases in business processes. Its AI-driven on-demand process reengineering engine composes process enhancements with rule-based associations with business objects for delivering quantified time, process, margin and cost efficiency gains. The on-demand compositions can be subject to review by functional subject matter experts in CRM, ERP, MRP, order-to-cash etc. before deploying them into live business processes. Ongoing client engagements include self-optimizing a wide spectrum of business processes including master data management, order-to-cash, sales distribution and supplychain management. The company is based in Palo Alto and venture funded by The Hive. The Hive is a fund and co-creation studio for AI powered enterprise applications.</p>
