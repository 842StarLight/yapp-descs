<h2>VP Operations</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>AndPlus is a growing digital technology agency with a goal to become the mid-market leader in Digital Transformation. We have an immediate need for an operational leader or executive who can help us keep our strong culture and scale our services across disciplines. Agency experience is preferred, but a long and demonstrated history of working directly with customers in digital transformation could hit the mark too.</p>
<p>
Think: Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, or Gwynne Shotwell of SpaceX</p>
<p>
Success in this role has the following characteristics:</p>
<p><b>
1 - People-first</b><br>
You are of high-integrity and love working with people, improving their work products, and helping develop them into our future leaders. You understand culture deeply and can align personal and professional goals to our company strategy. We have an amazing team, positioning our team members for success is a top priority.<br>
</p>
<p><b>2 - Deeply strategic but detail-oriented</b><br>
We have a big goal: to become the mid-market leading agency in Digital Transformation. That means organic growth, inorganic growth, expanding capabilities, and people integration. It means taking a competitive view, a market focus, and an obsession with great process. Taking this vision and building the company from our current state of 50 to 500 will take a mature, deliberate, and disciplined approach toward growth.<br>
</p>
<p><b>3 - Know-the-numbers</b><br>
Measuring progress is critical to growing. As an agency, our customers invest in the time and experience of our team. Our team’s efforts need to be aligned with client vision, value, and expectations, and our team needs to be compensated for their efforts and experience. We win by delivering immense value for customers and holding our team members accountable for the numbers. Measuring that value, incentivizing the team in creative ways, and bringing the average of our team up will make the right candidate successful in this role.<br>
</p>
<p><b>4 - A love for process</b><br>
Our customers are happiest when they can predict when they’ll receive deliverables and are involved in major decisions. We are rooted in Agile/Scrum as our development process, which we believe is the best way to deliver software. However, we recognize it isn’t always the best way to deliver customer service. Molding the process to work best for our team and our customers is critical, and being the advocate for process-oriented delivery will make us successful.<br>
</p>
<p><b>5 - Growth-mindset</b><br>
AndPlus is committed to growth and our team. We expect this role to drive growth in all areas of our business. As such, this role will serve as part of our senior leadership team, and will lead to the COO position for the right candidate.<br>
</p>
<p><b>6 - High impact, low ego</b><br>
There’s not a lot of room at AndPlus for egos, and the team’s success is the most important outcome. The successful manager and leader is direct, respectful, and helpful at all times. High impact is a core value for this role.<br>
</p>
<p><b>7 - Forward-thinking and Highly adaptable</b><br>
In true “Agile” form, a successful operations executive should be able to answer “What are we doing today,” “What are we doing next week,” “What is blocking us from our vision,” and “What will the company be doing next year at this time?” More important, the best can answer "Why are we doing it?”<br>
