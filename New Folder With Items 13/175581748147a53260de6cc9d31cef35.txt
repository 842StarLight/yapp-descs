<b>We were born to chase what we are true to.</b><br>
<b>It’s not that we want to… WE HAVE TO.</b><br>
<b>We have a vision that turns obstacles into</b><br>
<b>opportunity.</b><br>
<b>A creative courage to tempt the impossible…</b><br>
<b>And embrace the strange.</b><br>
<b>Telling us to push further…</b><br>
<b>To try again.</b><br>
<b>Endlessly seeking elevation…</b><br>
<b>We are all connected by this same internal force.</b><br>
<b>Forever we chase that intoxicating moment when</b><br>
<b>our vision is realized…</b><br>
<b>The world around us goes quiet…</b><br>
<b>And for brief moments, we are more than alive.</b><br>
