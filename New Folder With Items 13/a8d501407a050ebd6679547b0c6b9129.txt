<h2>Part Time Proctor (Customer / Student Exam Support) - Temp to Perm</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<b>The Company:</b><br>
Headquartered in Birmingham, AL, ProctorU a growing software business (recently partnered with Google) on a mission to uphold the integrity of academic and professional testing. We use technology - not to "catch cheaters" - but to build trust in the expansion of access to education. Our team is responsible for building and supporting digital solutions trusted by over 1,000 institutions in 129 countries who administer over 2,000,000 exams per year and we plan to continue growing!
<br><br>
<b>The role:</b><br>
ProctorU is seeking several service-oriented individuals (some temporary, others not) to be the face of ProctorU in our offices located in Folsom, CA and Riverchase, AL.
<br><br>
This is a great opportunity to get "your foot in the door" at ProctorU. A large population of our long-tenured employees started in this exact role (software engineers, sales, implementations, product managers, etc.). It's a fantastic way to earn extra money while learning the product!
<br><br>
In this role, you will provide world class customer service to customers (Test Takers) by setting up and facilitating exam sessions while also ensuring integrity in the testing process.
<br><br>
From time to time, the Proctor may initiate an Active Intervention. Active interventions are defined as any action that is taken by a Proctor during an examination to correct an action taken by the test taker, clarify an expectation of behavior, or stop a potential breach from occurring.
<br><br>
<b>The things you’ll do:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Proctor exams and other tests, virtually (from the comfort of our office)</li>
<li>Manage more than one exam at a time</li>
<li>Serve as a liaison between Operations staff and test takers to ensure resolution of disconnect issues that may occur during the exam process due to internet connectivity and other technical issues</li>
<li>Log Active Interventions so they can be reported on at a Company level. Active interventions will be logged when one of the following actions is taken by a proctor during the examination process:</li>
</ul>
o Request the test-taker to re-scan the physical environment with a camera pan
<br>o Request the test-taker change their environment by adjusting their camera or room lighting
<br>o Stop the test-taker from speaking or reading aloud
<br>o Request that the test-taker remove another person from the room
<br>o Remind the test-taker that they are not allowed to look off screen during testing
<br>o Stop a test-taker from using unpermitted materials during their exam session
<br><br>
It is our belief that most test takers can be deterred with a friendly reminder of the rules during the examination process and therefore we can proactively prevent a breach of the exam integrity from occurring. A previously reported metric of “prevented breaches” did not include the incidents of correcting and clarifying behavior before the more serious incidents occurred, therefore the logging and measuring of active intervention incidents allow us to better report on the quality of the proctoring process and provides a clearer vision of the value of our services we provide.
<br><br>
<b>Additional Information:</b><br>
This position will start as a temporary assignment (up to 90 days). Some Proctors will be offered a more permanent position, depending on performance and demand.
<br><br>
Schedules are typically 20-25 hours per week but up to 40 hours per week will be requested during peak volume times (mid-terms and finals).
