<h2>Franchisee</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Orion Talent, the nation’s largest military recruiting firm, is currently recruiting transitioning or former military professionals for Franchisee positions with the premier playground install company in the United States. Our client’s extensive six-month training program, in combination with a strict eye for detail and accumulated 40 years of experience in the playground and park industry, is what sets it apart from all other installation specialists. The company employs Certified Playground Safety Inspectors (CPSI), master carpenters, metal mechanics, tool and die machinists, and other installation specialists in order to facilitate any need in the varied and demanding world of construction and installation.

Position Description
<br>As a Franchisee, you are a real business owner. Our client’s corporate team handles all of the sales and marketing for the company—you will be responsible for building and hiring your own team, managing your own budget, and taking on projects across the country. Position information includes:
<br><ul>
<li>You are not responsible for purchasing the playground equipment. The company is strictly an installation company.</li>
<li>You are more than welcome to advertise, but as mentioned previously, the sales and marketing are handled by corporate. This is a very unique industry where most of your advertising is through word of mouth and referrals. Our client’s affiliate has been in the industry for 7 years and has never once placed an ad—not even in the yellow pages.</li>
<li>You will be responsible for hiring your own crew. The recommended crew size is 2-3.</li>
</ul>
Position Details
<br><b>Location:</b> Houston, TX
<br><b>Salary:</b> As a business owner, your salary is determined by how much business you take on and how well you manage your own budget. The average Franchisee probably takes home between $120K-150K his/her first year, however, the sky is the limit. The company has had Franchisees, who were willing to take on projects anywhere in the country, and take home well over $200K in their first full year on the job.
<br><b>Startup Costs:</b> The total Franchisee Fee is $60K
<br><ul>
<li>$10K is the minimum you are required to put down. There is in-house financing available to help cover the remainder.</li>
<li>Royalty fees are 13% of gross sales. If you put down the minimum $10K required for the Franchisee Fee, the company will take a 25% royalty fee until the entire Franchise Fee is paid off. At that point, it will drop to 13%.</li>
<li>You will be also required to purchase a truck (if you don’t have one already) as well as your own tools to complete the projects. Our client does not require you purchase a specific truck model—it just needs to look presentable and be serviceable. Additionally, many of the tools needed can most likely be found in your garage.</li>
</ul>
Position Requirements
<br><ul>
<li>No prior experience necessary. Our client will train you for everything you need to know, both in the office and in the field.</li>
