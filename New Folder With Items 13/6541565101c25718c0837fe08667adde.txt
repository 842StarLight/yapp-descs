<div>
<div><div>
<div>A mentorship experience that gives students an opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to a new product development and manufacturing environment. This co-op will gain practical experience to develop engineering judgment, with increasing independent control over design decisions, processes, adaptations, and/or modifications. Functions may include, but not limited to, performing tests, process changes using 3D modeling and Oracle, gathering and preparing data, and giving presentations. Depending on experience level, they will be given opportunities to lead their own projects.</div>
