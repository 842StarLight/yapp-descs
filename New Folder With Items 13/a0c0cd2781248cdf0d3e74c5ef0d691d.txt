<p><b>Avante Group, Inc.</b> is seeking a <b>Nurse Marketing Liaison</b> to foster strong, effective and efficient care relationship between facility residents, family members, facility staff and other healthcare providers in the local community. The NML serves as an advocate for residents beginning during the pre-admissions process and continues throughout the resident's stay at an Avante facility and after the resident is discharged. In Avante's long-term care and rehabilitation environment, the NML establishes a resident's eligibility for care, communicates with families and interacts with a wide range of facility staff members, from Directors of Sales and Marketing, to Internal Admissions Coordinators, to healthcare providers, and Avante's regional marketing team members. The NML is often the first to assess potential residents, reviews medical records, and determines whether a potential resident should be admitted for care to an Avante facility. The NML explains the types of care and services Avante facilities offer to residents and their family members. The NML also works with other facility staff and outside providers to schedule physician visits and other medical-related sessions outside the facility, if needed. The NML verifies a potential resident's health insurance and its coverage (i.e., private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid). The NML will coordinate with other facility staff members to ensure smooth resident discharge and transition to home or other medical facility. Duties of the NML also include training of other facility staff members in the NML's area(s) of expertise.</p>
