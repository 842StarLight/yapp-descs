<p>We need someone with demonstrated user conference experience. That is, experience with conferences for which attendees are paying a registration fee to attend. Therefore, it isn't just any internal conference - you are experienced in driving registration through strong marketing plans, in building registration tools, in engaging the latest event technologies to create a trend-forward event, in building a sponsorship and exhibit program that will drive budgetary success, in helming the project plan to end all project plans that manages our team and all of our client's deadlines, in being point for multi-million dollar budget, in being the primary "brain" for anything and every thing that goes on at the event, and in being a driver to leverage your resources and push the project to success no matter what it needs.</p>
<p>For someone who loves people, communicating and writing, being uber organized, someone who dorks out on business saavy, loves the details, eats up process implementation, periodic traveling, is just plain smart, and has a passion for conferences &amp; meetings – this is a dream job!</p>
<p>People who work well with us are fast-paced overachievers who love the flexibility our company offers for them to rapidly mold their own job and destiny at the company – these folks tend to be: detail-oriented, have to do lists for their to do lists, are always putting their hand up for more, and love taking care of customers!</p>
<p><b>What you’ll love: </b></p>
<p>You get to work as part of a fun, positive, and creative team all dedicated to the world of events. You'll love coming to work in our collaborative, modern office space in Minnetonka. With having our sister event decor/design company located in the same building, Festivities, you'll be surrounded by beautiful and inspiring things as well as being eligible for an employee discount through that company.</p>
<p>We offer traditional benefits like medical and dental as well as new benefits like walking treadmill desks, a unique working space, flexibility in working hours, lots of fun company activities, ability to dabble in other areas of the company, and more!</p>
<p><b>What you’ll do: </b></p>
<p>We tend to specialize in "conferences" - whether they are annual user conferences, educational conferences, sales kickoffs, sales meetings, sales roadshows, and incentive trips. Sometimes we tackle trade shows, special events, and galas too. The level of relevant experience you bring and the specific talents we recognize in you will dictate some of how we frame up your initial responsibilities.</p>
<p>Division of responsibilities is dependent upon the strengths of the individual we select. Strong preference will be given to those who have strengths in project management, project plans, budgeting, attrition management, user conferences, event technology, brand/attendee experience activations, and conference best-practices.</p>
<p>You will participate in other projects as the timeline for your primary client allows.</p>
<p><i>For us, “Planning an event” can entail everything from: </i>networking and sales process, proposal and contract development, budget creation &amp; invoicing, project plan development and updating, project tool implementation, site selection and hotel contracting, vendor contracting, client meetings &amp; notes, internal meetings, logistical detail tracking, food &amp; beverage management, travel &amp; transportation management, session and sponsor management, registration, attendee communication and customer care, vendor specifications, event technology, mobile apps, &amp; websites, event production &amp; AV, sponsor &amp; exhibitor management, gifts &amp; giveaways, research, pricing/costing, financial tracking, analytics, KPI tracking, event marketing, event design &amp; décor, project management, client management, printing, signage, shipping, onsite event management, post event surveys, post event reconciliation, and post event analysis.</p>
<p>In the end, you will be a team-spirited individual who will leverage project timelines and tools and learn our planning system in order to expertly guide the logistical management of these events.</p>

<p>Every person on the team is an integral part of the company sales and business development functions and this position has the opportunity to take a lot of responsibility in that area.</p>
