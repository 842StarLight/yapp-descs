Contracted Job Compensation:</b></p>
<p>
~$26,000 <b><i>(1)</i></b> to ~$40,000 <b><i>(2)</i></b> annually, plus up to $3,000 or more in commission and client-based opportunities. <b><i>(3)</i></b></p>

<p><b>
Contracted Job Compensation Specifications:</b></p>
<p>
Compensation is on a per assignment, sliding scale basis. All compensation amounts are completely dynamic and are based on the assumption that the contractor will be awarded and successfully complete a minimum of 20 assignments per week over the span of a typical 5-day period. Awarded assignments can range from 10 minutes to 1 hour, with time spent over 1 hour compensated in 10-minute increments. Consequently, should a contractor be awarded 20 or more assignments per week, based on their declared availability, their compensation will be higher.</p>
<p>
Compensation per assignment includes all time, including travel time, and assignment-related expenses (fuel, tolls, parking, etc.,) and is based on the contractor providing their own commercial insurance policies, and is further based on the contractor remaining in full compliance in process and submission of required paperwork, shipping off parts and equipment, and delivery of parts and equipment to one of our designated storage facilities or client assigned storage facilities.</p>
<p>
There may be commission-based opportunities should the contractor wish to participate in our product sales program, as well as some client-based opportunities to generate additional compensation per awarded assignment.</p>
