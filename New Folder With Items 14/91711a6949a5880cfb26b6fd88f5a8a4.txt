<b>Job Description:</b><br>
<p>If you have a hunter sales mentality but you can also foster and maintain client relationships then I want to talk to you. As an Account Executive, you will sell our shared mail, solo mail and digital advertising programs, along with data-driven marketing solutions to small local businesses in the Restaurant, Automotive, Furniture, Mattress, Hardware, Grocery, and Fitness &amp; Salon categories.

The Company’s business success stems from a simple premise&amp;mdash: to provide measureable results and a solid return on the customer’s marketing investment. Mspark is uniquely positioned with access to more than 23 million U.S. households in 27 states and 550+ markets, and its 98% household penetration in non-metro geographies is unsurpassed by competitors. Mspark’s portfolio of more than 3,000 clients includes consumer packaged goods manufacturers, retailers and service providers across the United States. If you think print is dead, think again.
