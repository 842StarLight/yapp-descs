<h2>Data Entry Specialist - Temporary, Part-Time</h2>

<p>In 1944, a group of regional truck leasing company owners met in Chicago to discuss how they could work together to provide maintenance for one another as their trucks began to travel across the country. From that meeting, NationaLease was born. Today, maintenance and the technicians who provide it still form the backbone of the NationaLease system. We are looking to strengthen our team with people who share our passion for providing a high level of quality and service to our customers. If you are that sort of person, we’d love to hear from you.
