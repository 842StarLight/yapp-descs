<p>This Project Manager role lives within Granicus’ govService product family and is a key member of the Professional Services (PS) team. This team helps customers (government agencies) transform the citizen experience. Project Managers lead and execute projects in support of Granicus’ suite of Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions. We do this through specialized teams of digital communication, web, and legislative experts. Project Managers have access to in-house digital strategists, implementors, designers, developers, and trainers who share Granicus’ standards of excellence across client deliverables and relationships.
 </p>
<p>This particular Project Manager will reside in Oklahoma, and help us expand a newly acquired SaaS offering into the US market. You’ll manage our flagship customer project and possibly others. You’ll also flex into internal areas of this emerging part of the business. The main project includes the “boots-on-the-ground” roll-out of the govService platform and driving adoption of MyServices – a core component. Your role includes light account management – enough to relay needs to Sales and Customer Support/Success teams. Customers are enabled and encouraged to utilize the system to its fullest potential. You’ll help our public sector customers update their processes – often weighing options that challenge the status quo. You are highly consultative, a trusted advisor.</p>
<p>
MyServices are designed as best-of-breed Forms and Processes which Granicus develops in conjunction with customers to deliver an “out-of-the box” solution. Government agencies have similar broad citizen requirements of digital services, and MyServices allow us to release complex products such as permitting and licensing processes - on a ‘build-once/deploy many times’ basis to different customers. This is a field position.</p>
