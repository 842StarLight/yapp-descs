<h2>Controller</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Skilljar is looking for a Controller to join our fast-growing team, with the goal of developing and executing accounting policies and processes for our future stages of growth. This individual will be working closely with our VP of Finance and business unit leaders to ensure that our books are kept up to date for quick decision making and reporting. The ideal candidate must be extremely detail-oriented, efficient, collaborative, and have a deep understanding of GAAP.
<br><br>
In a fast-changing startup, the role will require the Controller to be flexible, open-minded, hands-on, and able to operate with a scalable yet adaptable mindset. You'll be responsible for managing all accounting-related systems and processes of the company including, but not limited to, budgeting, general company accounting practices, payroll, taxes, and regulatory filings, designing and monitoring internal controls, and maintaining financial information systems. Partnering with other members of the finance team, this role will be very hands-on in owning the entire accounting process - from setting policy, maintenance of day to day accounting functions, and the production of financial statements, management reports, and board-level summaries.
<br><br>
This leader will need input from a variety of Skillets and must be an effective collaborator, working cross-functionally with other team leads to ensure that we have a scalable process in place to manage Skilljar's accounting in a GAAP compliant way while the organization continues to rapidly grow.
<br><br>
We're looking for a motivated, self-starter who is comfortable wearing multiple hats and thrives in a dynamic environment. You must be nimble, highly-collaborative, and able to think on your feet. This is a great opportunity to join a rapidly accelerating startup that has dozens of Fortune 1000 and mid-market clients on its roster.
