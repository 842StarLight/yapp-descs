<p><b>NACA</b>
</p>
<p>NACA is the country’s preeminent non-profit homeownership and advocacy organization with over two million Members through over forty-five offices nationwide. Over the past thirty years NACA has established a track record that has earned both the respect and fear from others in the lending industry. NACA stands out in the following areas: 1) It is the most effective organization in the country in providing affordable homeownership; 2) It is the place to work to fight for economic justice for those dedicated and willing to work hard; and 3) It provides unprecedented opportunities for staff to do well financially by doing good.
</p>
<p>Started in 1988, NACA has won campaigns against some of the country’s most powerful companies and individuals that engaged in predatory and discriminatory lending. NACA’s success is a result of its aggressive, confrontational advocacy and state-of-the-art systems and operations. The purchase program provides comprehensive counseling as HUD’s largest housing counseling agency (through its Neighborhood Stabilization Corporation subsidiary) with access to NACA’s Best in America mortgage: no down payment, no closing costs, no requirement for perfect credit and always at a below-market, fixed interest rate. NACA has over $15 billion in mortgage commitments from the country’s largest lenders to support this program. Through its HomeSave program for homeowners with an unaffordable mortgage, NACA is also the most effective in providing affordable solutions and has done so for over 250,000 at-risk homeowners nationwide.
</p>
<p>Built on this track record of success, NACA is undertaking rapid expansion across the country with the hiring of many additional staff nationwide. NACA continues its aggressive advocacy in fighting for economic justice for low-to-moderate income people and communities. In addition to affordable homeownership, NACA takes on economic justice issues such as student debt, tax equity, income inequality, environmental and other issues. Employees at NACA have a tremendous impact on the communities and the Members they serve. For more information about NACA, its history and programs, visit www.naca.com.<br>
