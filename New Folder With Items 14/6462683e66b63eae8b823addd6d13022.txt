In 2009, Accordion set out to prove that there was a better way to work in finance – and more specifically, a better way to unlock value potential in private equity portfolio companies. In the years since, our firm has grown into a bi-coastal team of 100+ finance and technology professionals, serving nearly 200 of the world's leading private equity firms out of offices in New York, San Francisco, and Boston.
<br><br>
Our mission is to shape a new era in the private equity industry. Focusing exclusively on the office of the CFO of PE-backed companies, we're committed to driving value creation through financial consulting services and portfolio operations technology.
<br><br>
So, what does it mean to work at Accordion? It means thriving in a high-growth, agile, and collaborative environment. It means changing the way private equity firms create value at their portfolio companies. And ultimately, it means making your mark on the firm's future – by embracing a culture rooted in humility and a firm-wide commitment to building something great, together.

Financial Accounting &amp; Advisory Services
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br><br>
With the increase in complexity of the business environment and transactions, CFO's of private equity backed companies are increasingly being looked towards to drive strategic insights for their business. Finance organizations are no longer simply result reporters, but rather, they couple these results with forward looking data to provide strategic insights which are leveraged to make business decisions. Efficiency of process and meaningful control environments allows for speed of financial reporting with increasingly accurate measures, leaving more time for the finance team to add future enterprise value, rather than look backwards.
<br><br>
Accordion's FAAS Practice is comprised of a dedicated team providing accounting and financial advice to support PE backed portfolio companies on a wide range of transactions and events, including Accounting Policies &amp; Procedures, ERP/Financial System Execution, Financial Statement Close Process, Process &amp; Controls Implementation, Technical Accounting, Finance/Accounting Assessment &amp; Design and Finance &amp; Accounting Organization Standup resulting from a Carve out or Merger transaction. We are doers and problem solvers – making sense of complexity and bolstering sponsors' value creation thesis's.
