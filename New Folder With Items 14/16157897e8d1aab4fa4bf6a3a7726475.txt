<br>Consumer Insights Research Manager
<br>----------------------------------
<br><br>
At Lenati, research and analytics are embedded in the process our consultants use when working with clients to drive marketing and product strategy as well as make data-informed business decisions. You will be client-facing, working with fellow consultants, conducting and delivering research integrated into broader business topics, objectives, and outcomes.
<br><br>
As an insights research expert, you should be ready to step beyond a traditional research role into one where you use existing and primary research to inform broad strategy recommendations that drive real businesses decisions. Your need to tell a story should outweigh your desire to employ specific design methodologies or tools. Your ability to recognize patterns and follow threads to insights and stories is paramount.
<br><br>
You will develop methodologies and establish best practices that will be used throughout the firm. However, this is neither a "back-room" nor programming/fielding role. You will have the opportunity be a driver of insights excellence at Lenati and will be building your personal brand as a thought leader and "go-to" person in this space.
