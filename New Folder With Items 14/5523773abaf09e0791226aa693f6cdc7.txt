<b>Our Mission:</b><br>
Our mission is to cultivate a safer digital world for children. We see the internet as a space for learning and exploration, and social media as an opportunity to develop emotional intelligence and social competence. The internet brings many benefits to children's development and learning but also presents many concerns.
<br><br>
Our goal is not to censor the internet, but to mitigate the negative effects it can have on kids. We develop solutions to keep children safe online wherever they are - at school, at home or out in the world. From tools to help adults create a safer internet to an AI that recognizes signs of bullying and even intuits risks of self-harm, Securly continues to build technology and innovate solutions to support online safety and healthy digital lives for children.
