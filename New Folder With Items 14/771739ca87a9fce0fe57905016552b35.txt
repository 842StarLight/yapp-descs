The Mid-Ohio Valley includes the communities of Parkersburg, WV and Marietta, OH and the 50-mile area surrounding them. It’s the kind of place where you can walk down the street and say “hi” to people and they’ll say “hi” right back at you! It’s the kind of place where local news-people become like family to the viewers and on-line readers they serve and communicate with. There are wonderful parks, great hiking and biking areas, high-quality restaurants, and shopping – whether you like a mall or the uniqueness of small stores on main street. Our area is big on heritage and the many fairs and festival reflect that passion. Marietta College gives its hometown a New England feel. Ohio University and the community of Athens, Ohio, are nearby.
<br>The Ohio River is the common thread that runs through everything and the Blennerhassett State Park, located on an island of the same name very close to Parkersburg, is a historic and beautiful place to get away to on a summer day.
<br><br>
There’s much to see and do within a couple of hours drive from our location in Western West Virginia and Southeastern Ohio. Whitewater rafting, snow skiing and so much more are available in the mountains of West Virginia. The locally situated Mid-Ohio Valley regional airport and airports in Charleston, West Virginia, and Akron, Columbus, and Cleveland, Ohio, give you access to anywhere you want to go. Wherever you may travel though,
<br>Our area is proud of its history and heritage with roots in oil and industry which have helped shape our region into what it is today. WTAP’s commitment to serve the Mid-Ohio Valley, the place that we call home, shows that it doesn’t matter what the market size… we are here doing what really matters.
