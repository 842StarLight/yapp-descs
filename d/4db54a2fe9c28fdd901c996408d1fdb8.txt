<br>
</p>
<p><b>The Role: Conversion Copywriter
</b></p>
<p>At Autobooks, our mission is to help small businesses thrive by providing tools to streamline<br>
their billing &amp; accounting tasks. We're seeking a conversion copywriter with a growth<br>
marketing background to 1) help us craft messages that capture small business owners'<br>
attention, and 2) boost conversion rates along our entire customer journey.
</p>
<p>Are you a skilled growth marketer who knows how crucial the right words are in compelling<br>
people to take action?
</p>
<p>Maybe you've been in "Jack-or-Jill-of-all-trades" marketing roles before...
</p>
<ul>
<li>You know conversion rate optimization principles like the back of your hand.</li>
<li>You've dabbled in data &amp; analytics.</li>
<li>You're proud of some of the high-converting marketing campaigns you've already run
</li>
</ul>
<p>in your career — whether they were PPC, organic content marketing, or launching<br>
email nurture sequences that generated sky-high open and click-through rates.
</p>
<p>You're a marketer who knows that "growth" means more than just pouring more leads into the<br>
"top of the funnel" — it requires keeping existing customers highly engaged, reducing churn,<br>
and turning your best customers into champions who rave about your product to their friends.
</p>
<p>But at your core, you're a writer. What <i>really lights you up</i> is getting inside customers' heads,<br>
figuring out exactly where the "leaky holes" are in their journey with your product, and<br>
distilling customer insights into messages &amp; copy that <i>patch</i> those holes (aka, boost<br>
conversions) at each stage of the journey.
</p>
<p>You're looking for an opportunity to move beyond driving leads into a funnel. You want to<br>
leverage your stellar writing skills collaboratively with Sales, Support, Product, &amp; Engineering<br>
</p>
</div></div>
<p></p>
<div><div>
<br>
<p>to create a higher-performing customer experience overall — and you'll find that here at<br>
Autobooks.
</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>About us</b>
</p>
<p>At Autobooks, we partner with banks &amp; credit unions, and provide their small business<br>
customers the tools they need to create &amp; send invoices, accept credit card payments, and<br>
manage their accounting tasks — all from right inside their business bank accounts.
</p>
<p>We make it easier than ever for small business owners — your mechanic, your family portrait<br>
photographer, your favorite cupcake shop owner — to streamline the financial side of their<br>
businesses, so they can spend more time doing the work they really love.
</p>
<p>When a bank or credit union wants to establish themselves as a leader in providing digital<br>
financial services, we're the vendor they turn to. And we want your ideas, passion and<br>
experience to help us continue improving what we offer.
</p>
<p><b>About the role</b>
</p>
<p>We've invested heavily in understanding our small business customers: their desires, their<br>
pain points, and the struggles that motivate them to find &amp; switch to Autobooks. This<br>
investment informs everything about our business — including, of course, the messaging &amp;<br>
copy we use to resonate with small business owners.
</p>
<p>As a member of our Growth team, you'll work closely with a friendly, collaborative, fast-paced<br>
crew to create compelling copy that converts more small business owners into new<br>
Autobooks customers, and more of our new customers into long-term satisfied users. The<br>
messaging strategies and copy you deliver will serve to directly impact our growth.
</p>
<p>As a Growth team, we're driven by the metric of helping small business owners be more<br>
successful at every stage of our customer journey — not by our own egos. We appreciate<br>
creative ideas, moving quickly, and attention to detail. Everyone here rolls up their sleeves<br>
and does work: you'll not only be responsible for coming up with strategies, you'll also help<br>
execute.
