About Our Dealership</b></p>
<p><i>
Bretz RV &amp; Marine opened for business in Missoula, Montana, in 1967. Up until then, Frank and Vi Bretz had been operating a service station and renting U-Hauls in central Missoula. A search for a new camping trailer ended up turning into a new business opportunity. Not only did the Bretz family get a new camper, they decided to get into the business of selling and renting small travel trailers.</i></p>
<p><i>
Bretz opened at its current location in Missoula along Interstate 90 in 1999 and has been constantly expanding ever since. In 2008, Bretz purchased Tour America RV Center in Billings, Montana, which has grown into a brand new dealership on 35 acres of freeway frontage. In 2011, Bretz added a new dealership in Boise, Idaho. Bretz RV and Marine’s newest location in Nampa, Idaho, was added in 2017 and we are continuing to expand sales and service across the region. In addition, we have Bretz Capital Sports Sales Inc., in Boise, ID and Gull Boats &amp; RV in Missoula, MT, making for six total locations!</i></p>
<p><i>
The current Missoula store sits on almost 45 acres, has 26 fully equipped service-bays with a complete collision repair center, nearly twenty thousand square feet of indoor showroom, and one of the largest accessory stores in the northwest. Due to the hard work of the entire Bretz RV &amp; Marine team, Bretz has become the largest dealer in a five-state region.</i></p>
