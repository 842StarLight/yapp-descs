A typical day will include a morning call with your sales colleagues to ensure their prospects understand the specifics of the onboarding program you are about to kick off. After that, you run a strategy call with a key real estate partner to help define their e-closing strategy in two new states. After lunch you put the finishing touches on a Quarterly Business Review scheduled for tomorrow morning. You close your day by attending a tribe meeting with the product team to review user feedback you’ve collected.</div>
