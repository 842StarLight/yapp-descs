<b>Job Description:</b><br>
<p>Background behind this search: For the past 25+ years, FreeWave has been a demonstrated leader in the manufacturing of ruggedized radio systems for the industrial marketplace with significant market share in both oil and gas and government and defense verticals. Two plus years ago, FreeWave made a strategic decision to develop new solutions around edge computing, sensing and the critical automation and analytics applications required for industrial enterprises to truly leverage the power of accessible data and actionable intelligence. This migration to a new edge platform represents a significant departure from what has been our traditional radio business but is now recognized as a true opportunity for the FreeWave to grow their revenue while expanding into new vertical markets. For this reason, FreeWave is set on recruiting a true Product Management leader, a Director of Product Management who has the supervisory experience, technical acumen, and market knowledge to lead the FreeWave short and long term product roadmap and support strategy. If you are a creative, take-charge product leader who is already working in a similar capacity and has experience with edge computing, security, storage and cloud, we would like to talk to you.
