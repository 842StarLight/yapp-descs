Who you are</b></p>
<p>
A Sales Enablement professional who believes their job is a vital role to increasing the efficiency of the Sales Org from onboarding to ongoing training. Someone with both a technical and personal mindset, this person will be able to analyze sometimes complex data sets in our CRM (SFDC) as well as own our Sales Enablement and Marketing Automation platform (Showpad) to understand in detail the different facets of product updates and releases, all while being able to communicate those details to the Sales team in a concise way so they in turn can communicate those points to our customers. This role will be responsible for developing and maintaining our ‘sales playbook’ while also coaching reps on how to use our Sales Tool kit so thriving in the Presentation setting at the leadership level is also a must. The Sales Enablement Manager will be a Strategic part of our Sales Org, working closely with the Sales and Customer Success leadership teams to develop messaging around Marketing and Product releases but also providing much needed bandwidth coverage to those leaders so you will ideally have a collaborative mindset around how to work with all teams involved. In this role you will focus on increasing the effectiveness of the Sales Organization so you will ideally be well versed in SaaS, selling to C-Level and Sales process &amp; methodology.</p>
