<h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>About BP:</b></h2>
<p>BP's BPX Energy business (formerly known as the Lower 48) operates across a vast US geography, from Texas north through the Rocky Mountains. The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins. In 2018, BP completed a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's world-class unconventional oil and gas assets in the Permian-Delaware basin in Texas, along with two premium positions in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins in Texas and Louisiana. These assets currently produce 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 45 percent are liquid hydrocarbons. The deal represents BP’s largest purchase since buying ARCO in 1999. It is a transformational acquisition for our BPX Energy business which gives the BPX Energy team access to some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S.</p>
