<div>Job Description</div>
<p></p>
<p>
 Zendesk is looking for a full-time, 6-month Intern to join our Strategic Events team at our HQ offices in San Francisco. We’re a team that plays hard, works harder, and strives to be humble, empathetic, and a little weird. We spend a lot of time together under stressful situations so we must get along, trust each other, and have fun with one another.</p>
<p>
During your internship you will gain first-hand knowledge of what it takes to manage a global customer facing event - pre, during, and post. You will have the opportunity to learn strategies, processes and systems that are fundamental in our events’ success. We seek a person that is eager to learn, a fearless problem-solver, shows initiative, and has a willingness to work with others to achieve common goals. Please note this is not an internship for Summer 2020, as we are looking to hire this individual immediately.
