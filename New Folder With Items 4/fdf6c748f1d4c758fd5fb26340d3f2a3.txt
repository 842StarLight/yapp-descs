<p><b>Job Title: </b> Business Development Coordinator</p>

<p><b>OVERVIEW </b></p>
<p>Amplio’s mission is to empower the world’s most vulnerable communities through knowledge sharing. Our rugged, battery-powered Talking Book audio device enables global development organizations to amplify their reach in remote, low- literate communities. Talking Books provide on-demand access to information in the user’s local language, empowering people to gain new skills and knowledge to improve their lives. Each Talking Book collects usage data and user feedback, which helps our partners monitor their programs, gain a deeper understanding of the communities they serve, and make data-driven decisions for program improvements. Amplio’s technology includes an audio content manager, a mobile app to update content and collect data in the field, and an analytics dashboard.</p>
