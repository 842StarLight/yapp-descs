<h2>Sr. Data Analyst</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Have you ever tried to hire a plumber? How about a house cleaner? If you have, chances are it took you way longer than it should. In the era of instant-everything, it's crazy that you still have to waste an entire afternoon researching, calling and vetting local service professionals whenever you need one. The market for hiring them is huge — $1 trillion in the US alone — but the process is inefficient and largely offline.
<br><br>
Thumbtack is transforming this experience end-to-end, building a marketplace that matches millions of people with local pros for almost any project. In making these connections, not only do our customers get more done every day, our pros are able to grow their businesses and make a living doing what they're great at.

<br>About the Operations Analytics Team
<br>-----------------------------------
<br><br>
Thumbtack's Ops Analytics team is a tight-knit group charged with providing actionable insights for Thumbtack's Go-to-Market and Operations teams. We collaborate with various groups across the company on a wide variety of projects; everything from click-level data from our online HelpCenter, to call-level data from our inbound support and outbound sales/success teams, to search- and conversation-level data between pros and customers from our product database.
