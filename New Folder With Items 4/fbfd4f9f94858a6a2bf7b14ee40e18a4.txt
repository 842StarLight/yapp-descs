<br>So, What is EquipmentShare?
<br>---------------------------
<br><br>
While running their construction companies, brothers Willy and Jabbok Schlacks were frustrated with the options they had for renting equipment. Renting was expensive, but owning a piece of equipment was just as costly; plus, it came with long-term maintenance expenses. Contractors didn't have good choices when it came to renting and owning equipment.
<br><br>
With more than 40 years of combined construction experience, they decided it was time to do things differently and build something, for once, for contractors. The brothers originally founded EquipmentShare as a peer-to-peer rental platform at Startup Weekend in Columbia, Missouri, in 2014 and proceeded to catapult their vision to market when they applied and were accepted into Y Combinator's accelerator program ( https://www.ycombinator.com/ ) in Mountain View, California, in 2015.
<br><br>
In just four years, EquipmentShare has evolved greatly as a business and expanded across the U.S. with our brick-and-mortar rental locations and we've captured customers in nearly every state with our cloud-connected telematics platform Track ( https://equipmentshare.com/track ). EquipmentShare today continues the mission of fostering innovation in the dated construction industry.
