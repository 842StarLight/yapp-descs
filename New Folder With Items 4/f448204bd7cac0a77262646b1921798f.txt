<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>So, you own a home. Maybe you just bought it. Maybe you’ve had it for years. One thing holds true for every owner – you love your home, but the headache of caring for it and paying for it when it breaks down can offset the joy of calling it your own. You want the dream of ownership without the drawbacks. You want to make expenses predictable, prevent problems from happening, and simplify with one-source for all service needs. Super is a subscription service that provides care and repair for your home. Super pays for repairs and breakdowns on your covered appliances and home systems. Super's maintenance schedule helps you understand the needs of your home, with the option of getting us to do it for you. Super’s concierge service manages the logistics for all your home service needs. From your desktop, tablet, or mobile phone, you’re only one tap away from getting the service you need for your home.</p>

<p><b>Your Mission</b></p>
<p>You will be responsible for sales of Super home subscriptions in the great Forth Worth Area.</p>

<p>You will be working together with residential real estate agents, brokers, office managers and regional managers to offer Super as an alternative to the old-school home warranty partners they work with today. Our real estate partners benefit by providing clients with a dramatic superior service, thereby, increasing client satisfaction and increasing agents’ sales from referrals in the future. Homeowners benefit from a much higher quality home warranty solution and an overall hassle-free homeownership experience.</p>
