<div><b>ES99: AN AGENCY WITHIN IMPACT</b></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>
Although officially established in 2018, ES99 was in the making for several years prior. As Impact’s rapid expansion brought more opportunities for optimizing businesses from the inside, it also uncovered a need for these businesses to improve their external presence for their customers’ branding &amp; marketing needs. The internal design division at Impact was re-imagined to meet these needs and ES99 was born.</div>
