<p>About Willow International</p>
<p>The mission of Willow International is to end human trafficking by attacking the problem in one of the world’s trafficking epicenters: Uganda. Through survivor care, government reform, and global partnerships, Willow believes it can help erase this plague and restore hope to millions of victims across the globe. Human trafficking is one of the fastest growing and most profitable criminal industries in the world. Today, there are more than 40 million victims of human trafficking worldwide with exploiters earning more than $150 billion annually. Mothers, daughters, sisters, sons, and fathers – innocent people – are sold and exploited so that these criminals can profit. Despite growing awareness of the issue, fewer than 1% of the victims are rescued. Uganda is one of the epicenters for human trafficking: with high unemployment, civil instability, and one of the youngest populations in the world, traffickers promising lucrative jobs are easily able to prey on vulnerable victims. Working collaboratively with the Ugandan Government, as well as local Ugandan and international organizations, Willow aids in the rescue of victims and restoration of survivors. Through its international partnerships, the organization provides legal aid to those in Willow’s care, disseminates information throughout Uganda, educates and advocates for the strengthening of the criminal justice system. Due to the success of its program, Willow remains the government’s top aftercare referral agency for victims of sex and labor trafficking.</p>
