<h2>Outside Sales Representative</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<div>
<p>RTN is the leading distributor of in store advertising in the United States<i>.</i> The company, founded in 1951, pioneered the register receipt advertising program, which is among the oldest nationally recognized in-store branding products.</p>
<p>
As an Outside Sales Executive, you will create lasting advertising partnerships between local businesses and large or small box retailers such as Dollar General and Family Dollar in the area.</p>
<p>
We are looking for a highly motivated, ambitious sales representative to join our team of fighters. Our ideal candidate will thrive in a fast-paced, “one-call one-close” environment and won’t be fazed by rejection.</p>
<p>
The right candidate will have the Right Attitude. What do we mean by this? Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do I “want it” and will I do everything it takes to “get it?”</li>
<li>
How do I take rejection; does it inspire me to try harder?</li>
<li>
Will I work even harder if I’m rewarded for my effort?</li>
<li>
Even if I don’t have the sales experience, do I have “The Drive?”</li>
<li>
Does my energy level match my ambition?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>
For the right candidate who answered “YES!” to these questions, you have the Right Attitude.</b></p>
<p><i>
What is the Outside Sales Executive job like?</i></p>
<p>
Representatives are assigned protected territories where they’re responsible for sharing our local advertising solution with local businesses.</p>
<p>
This position is true outside sales. Each workday, you will present RTN’s innovative branding opportunity to a variety of local businesses. Our sales model requires punctuality, organization, and daily work in the field.</p>
<p>
We have a proven “one-call one-close” system, but we’ve been around long enough to know that this skill-set can be taught — it’s something you can learn IF you have the Right Attitude and Drive!</p>
<p>
Before beginning your new career, our extensive training program will have you selling advertising space and earning commissions in just 3 weeks or less — even if you are new to the advertising industry.</p>
<p>
The best part is through good customer service and by building renewal clients within your territory you can continue to earn “residual commissions” long after you make the initial sale!</p>
<p>
Each representative is assigned a protected territory where he or she will cultivate relationships between our retail partners and local advertisers.</p>
<p>
 <i>Our salary and uncapped bonus structure is why our sales reps earn $60,000-$100,000 per year.</i></p>
<p>
We offer you the opportunity to earn what you deserve. We offer solid training, a protected sales territory, and a clear path to earning a minimum of $50,000 or more in the next 12 months.</p>
