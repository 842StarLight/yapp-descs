<p><b>In the continuous improvement mindset, the Commercial Bank is proposing to develop a tool that will provide machine learning driven insights to the bank’s Relationship Managers that will drive sales and a reduction in charge offs from early warning detection analytics.
</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Project Overview:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a web application that provides Regions’ commercial banking associates machine learning based solutions recommendations and attrition / credit distress flags based on client behavior modeling.
</li>
<li>The application has three core machine learning model suites:
<ul>
<li>Wallet Sizing (Next Best Product to Buy Model)
</li>
<li>Attrition Risk Model and Treatment Recommendation Engine
</li>
<li>Early Warning Indicator for Credit Distress and Treatment Rec. Engine
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regions’ Executive team is proposing to engage the Boston Consulting Group to co-develop the web application and modeling suite.
</li>
<li>The tool will help strengthen financial performance by helping bankers (1) avoid losses by identifying clients potentially in financial stress more quickly; (2) improve client retention and (3) identify needs that can be explored for suitability with the client.
</li>
<li>Lastly, the tool would support Continuous Improvement by providing better insight to allow bankers to more efficiently identify and react to client needs and issues in a consistent and timely manner throughout the footprint.
