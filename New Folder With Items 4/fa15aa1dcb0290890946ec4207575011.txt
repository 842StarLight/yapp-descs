<div><b>Our Story</b></div>
<div></div>
<div><div>
<div>Founded in October 2000, APEX Communications, LLC, is Arkansas’s largest AT&amp;T authorized retailer with 29 locations across Arkansas and 2 in Oklahoma. APEX is one of the fastest growing privately owned communications companies in the Southeast.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The APEX headquarters is based in Wynne, Arkansas, a typical Arkansas community, and is founded upon the Vision of “Being the BEST”. This translates in the communication industry to “being the BEST choice for customers in each market served”. Or, put another way, “to operate at the APEX of the Mountain of Success”.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Everything we do, from the people we hire, to the customer service we deliver, is all geared around being the BEST!</div>
<div></div>
<div>As the leading AT&amp;T authorized retailer in Arkansas, APEX provides the following services to the communities we serve:</div>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li>AT&amp;T wireless service for residential and commercial</li>
<li>AT&amp;T wireline service for residential and commercial</li>
<li>AT&amp;T Digital Life</li>
<li>AT&amp;T Uverse TV</li>
<li>AT&amp;T high speed internet, including Uverse</li>
<li>DirecTV</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div>(Note that not all services are available in all areas).</div>
<div></div>
<div>APEX began with 3 stores in Wynne, Forrest City, and Jonesboro in 2000. In June 2006, the acquisition of 8 retail locations of Go Wireless in South Arkansas became the catalyst to a steady stream of acquisition and de novo growth. This resulted in APEX operating 13 locations at the end of 2006, 19 at the end of 2007, and 29 at the end of 2008. APEX added its 30th location in September 2009 before focusing its attention on implementing new software and business processes to better train our employees and serve our customers.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In 2010, APEX was a finalist for Arkansas Business of the Year in recognition of its growth and success. Later that year, APEX entered the Georgia market and expanded into Oklahoma in 2013. These acquisitions bring the total number of APEX stores to 38. In early 2014, APEX sold the Georgia location in order to focus on the Arkansas and Oklahoma markets.</div>
<div></div>
<div>APEX has committed with AT&amp;T to remodel, expand or relocate our current locations in order to provide a better shopping experience for our customers. This growth has resulted in numerous efficiencies that benefit the CUSTOMER as it allows APEX to better deliver on its commitment to be the BEST by providing a wider range of product in a timely fashion at a great price for each community served.</div>
<div></div>
<div>APEX is actively involved in each community. The APEX shareholders were former principals in United Medical, a highly successful medical equipment company with 56 locations in 13 states, and brought over a foundational belief that “People do business with People”. We believe, even in this age of technology, that this is still true today. So, each location is involved in its local chamber of commerce and works to support its community. In addition, each location is staffed with local people that live, shop, and invest in that community.</div>
<div></div>
<div>APEX also believes it is “Blessed to be a Blessing”. As such, we work to give back. Each year, APEX conducts an “APEX Gives Back Christmas Campaign”. APEX has partnered with When Will We Cry? Inc. to make a Christmas donation based upon every activation sold from Thanksgiving until Christmas each year.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Finally, APEX seeks to operate its business with Christian principles of Integrity and “just doing the right thing”.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We believe all these things make APEX the BEST choice for YOU the Customer! Give us a try, we think you’ll come back and back and back…</div>
