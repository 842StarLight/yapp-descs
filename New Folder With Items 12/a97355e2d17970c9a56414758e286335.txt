<h2>Staff Technologist</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Cohesity ( https://www.cohesity.com/ ) is redefining data management from the ground up to solve a critical challenge facing businesses today: mass data fragmentation. Most enterprise data — backups, archives, file shares, object stores, and data used for test/dev and analytics — sits in fragmented infrastructure silos that
<br>make it hard to protect, expensive to manage, and difficult to analyze. Cohesity consolidates silos onto one web-scale platform, spanning on-premises, cloud, and the edge, and uniquely empowers organizations to run apps on that platform — making it easier than ever to back up and extract insights from data. We're a values-led company looking for great people who love challenges, are collaborative and curious, unafraid to try, and passionate about customer success.
