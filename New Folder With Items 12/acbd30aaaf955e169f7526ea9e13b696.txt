Position Overview</b></div>
<div>
The Cloud Solutions Specialist (CSS) is responsible for driving and co-owning software and services within his/her assigned region with a focus on cloud-based solutions. The person in this role is expected to take a consistently proactive approach to discovering software and services business in the region with new customers identified by associated teams or uncovered through self-driven discovery. The CSS is the lead in the region for initial sales success with new customers and serves as the expert on the customer’s software and services strategy as the customer is migrated to a management team that works to grow the breadth of the sales relationship.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div>In developing the initial success with a customer, the CSS will work with internal teams and external partners to define and deliver the combination of software and services that the customer requires to achieve their goals. To do so, the CSS will act as a liaison between Zones’ Professional Services teams, Solutions Architects, software partners, and infrastructure partners. The CSS will capture requirements from the customer, describe the elements of the solution, and help to create a Scope of Work (SoW) that will be used to define and price the solution.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div><b>Practice Summary and Role Expectations</b></div>
<div>
This team operates within the space of Public Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, and on-premises technologies. Our goal is to provide the expertise that identifies the software, services, and environment that will enable customers to operate in the environment that is best-suited for their goals.<br>
</div>
<div>The CSS role is not a fully technical role but demonstrated technical acumen at the level required to credibly describe a path from a customer’s current state to the desired state is a must. Demonstrating this level of competence will require holding or earning certifications in cloud and on-premises software and infrastructure. Effective CSS‘s will understand and be able to articulate the value of software as a service, professional services, and infrastructure choices involving the best-known partners in the industry including, but not limited to, Microsoft, VMware, AWS, Oracle, Symantec, Cisco, McAfee and many more. Beyond understanding how the technologies interact and support the customer’s goals, the CSS will have to understand the sometimes-complex licensing programs that are used by the producer of the product.<br>
