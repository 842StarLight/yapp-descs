Overview of the Role</b></p>
<p>
The right person for this role will have held an executive seat, will have had to make financially sound decisions in regard to M&amp;A and capital raising, and will have dug into financial considerations to make tough decisions. This role requires expertise in the sector, and requires the person to continue to build the Technology &amp; Business Services practice within G2 Capital Advisors. It requires you to provide senior-level advice and counsel to leaders and business owners who may be making the most difficult decisions of their professional careers. You will build the business by leveraging relationships to uncover M&amp;A buy and sell opportunities, capital raising and to help make the right business decisions. The right person understands that these transactions are as much emotional and personality-driven as financial, and can put the pieces together to help G2’s clients achieve their goals. You will pull on strategic and operational skills, as well as investment banking transactional skills, to get things done. You enjoy complex situations and during any given day, you will be hands-on with finding new opportunities and then seeing transactions through to closure – leveraging the powerful team within G2 Capital Advisors to accomplish this.</p>
