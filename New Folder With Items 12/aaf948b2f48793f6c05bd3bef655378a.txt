Ours is a busy, dynamic environment and change happens on short notice. You'll need to be flexible and adaptable, and willing to come in early and stay late as needed.<br>
<br>
You'll support executives with heavy and complex international travel; it's not unusual for our top leaders to travel two to three weeks a month.

<br>
<b>What's in It for You</b></p>
<p><b>

Our company strategy focuses on emerging areas of the automotive industry, including autonomous vehicles. This strategy is driven by constant innovation, and you will support our efforts through your role. We are recognized across the industry for innovation.

<br>

We have a variety of programs to support employees' ongoing development. Visteon is dedicated to providing employees with regular feedback through check-in conversations at key stages of projects.

</p>
<p><b>Keys to Success</b></p>
<p>
It's important enough that it bears repeating: The pace is fast, priorities change frequently, multitasking is critical and casual overtime will be required. It won't be unusual for you to have to put a current task on the back burner, take care of something more urgent, and then pick up where you left off.<br>
<br>
Your interpersonal skills will be important. You should bring a customer service orientation to the executives, board of directors and external customers and business partners. You've probably already realized that you'll coordinate among multiple stakeholders, and that can require diplomacy and patience.<br>
<br>
In addition, in order to be an outstanding Executive Assistant, you will:</p>

<li>Achieve individual goals independently and also contribute as a team player.</li>
<li>Take a proactive approach to getting up to speed quickly and continue to expand your knowledge and skills on an ongoing basis.</li>
