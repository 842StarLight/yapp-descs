Development Hub Stage<br>
You will begin your program in our Development Hub located in Charlotte, NC.

Upon successful completion of this six-month stage, you will transition to a Commercial Banking Office (CBO).</p>
<p>
Offers can be for a specific CBO, specialized team, metropolitan area, or region of the country. The location of the CBO, in the case of a metropolitan or regional offer, will be determined prior to completion of the six-months in the Development Hub.</p>
<p>
Commercial Banking Office Stage<br>
Upon your transition to a CBO, you will work alongside experienced Commercial Bankers to further deepen your knowledge and develop your analytical, underwriting, sales and relationship management skills by actively participating in your team’s day-to-day client and prospecting activities.</p>
