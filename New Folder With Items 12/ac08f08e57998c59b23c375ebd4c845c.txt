You will work on the Union back end. This exposes an API to the iPad based point of sale application deployed in venues, mobile loyalty app and the React based web app. Bartenders use the iPad app in the venues. GMs use the portal to configure the system and run the reports that help them manage their businesses. Venue customers use the loyalty app to pay their tabs. The backing system must be correct and available.
