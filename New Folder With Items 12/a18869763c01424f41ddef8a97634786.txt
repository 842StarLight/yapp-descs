<li>
<p>Work with national security professionals on their critical business questions and how they can be answered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lead quantitative and qualitative analysis to establish objective and accurate views of business operations and recommendations to improve performance.</p>

</ul>Qualifications
<p>This is a position for people who care deeply about logic. You want to make a contribution to national security by exploring a set of new questions not yet tackled, or applying a novel methodology to chronic problems with elusive answers. You like the big, meaty questions, and think about them constantly. You read analytic studies for fun. You step outside your current position to see the big picture, and consider relationships between tactical issues and national strategy. You accept that the nation is confronted with difficult decisions, want to frame real choices, and pro/con hard tradeoffs. You geek out on assumptions, talk shop with technocratic experts, and then translate quant to English for senior executives. You hold the line on what’s methodologically correct and call findings as you see them-be they good or bad news. You wonder why some still make decisions based on anecdotes or cherry-picked historical cases. Most of all, you pride yourself in being a keeper of the flame of logical, data-driven analysis.</p>
<p>
Required Skills</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>5-7 years of research analysis using quantitative methods or relative management consulting experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MBA or advanced degree in statistics or data science from a top-tier institution</p>
</li>
<li><p>Experience as a government analyst (DoD, OMB, DHS, Capitol Hill, CIA, DIA, or other)
</p></li>
<li>
<p>Deep knowledge of the defense industry, with specialized expertise in Supply Chain (particularly risk management), Operations Research, or the PPBE process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strong business acumen, excellent professional demeanor with a willingness to work outside of your comfort zone without hesitation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referenceable history of exceptional performance conducting high-quality analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outstanding listening, verbal, and written communication skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to manage multiple work-streams and projects from start to finish, to learn quickly, and to work independently with little supervision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced proficiency with one or more of the following; Microsoft Excel, Tableau, Qlik, SAS/SPSS/STATA, SQL, Python and/or R or technical equivalent</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Desired Skills</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Current possession of a U.S. security clearance or the ability to obtain one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience with the nuances of a startup environment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We firmly believe that past performance is the best indicator of future performance. If you believe you are an inquisitive problem-solver with experience that meets the qualifications above, and you're prepared to perform intricate, mentally rigorous work, we're eager to hear from you.<br>

"There are many professional services firms that just help manage processes around revenue capture. They, by hand, pull data and run metrics and shove stuff into Excel and in databases and come out with answers. In Govini, you can get the same answers in three clicks." - Federal Times</p>
