A little about us</h3>

Whether your forte is engineering, software development, manufacturing, or another role that supports the business, the common denominator is that we all put customers at the center of our universe.

A little more about us (if you care to keep reading)</h3>
<p>
Our coming of age story is pretty unique. The company started in a four-wall storefront in 1995 in suburban Chicago selling computer components to consumers from a catalog. We were wildly successful, even winning awards because people liked doing business with us. From there we expanded into building complete computing systems, and we kept growing - and moving - and expanding, until finally in 2012, we landed in Libertyville, IL, in an 84,000 square foot facility only about a half hour east of where we started.</p>
<p>
While we don’t build computers for consumers anymore, two things haven’t changed: hardware still runs through our veins and people still like doing business with us. Today we work with some of the largest technology companies in the world who deploy hardware-based products in some way, shape, or form. We operate other locations, too: a manufacturing and logistics facility in the EU - MBX Netherlands, and a regional sales and engineering office in San Jose, CA, plus stocking, logistics, and support services around the globe.</p>
<p>
We’ve won around 20 awards within the last decade for the kinds of things that our customers and employees value most: operational excellence, impeccable quality, a great company culture, maintaining a top workplace, and providing a world-class customer experience.</p>
