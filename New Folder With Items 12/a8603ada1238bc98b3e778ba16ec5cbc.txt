Interview Advice
<br><br>
Interviewing is not an easy thing and can feel very alien to many people. There's some things we'd like you to know if you are considering working with us.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Most importantly: WE WANT YOU TO SUCCEED. Our aim is not to catch you or make life difficult. When we interview, we're trying to figure out a couple of things</li>
<li>Would you be successful if you were part of our team</li>
<li>Would you love working here and be a positive influence in our team</li>
<li>Would you be able to grow and become more during your time here</li>
<li>We aim to provide a lot of feedback through our interview process, usually directly in the interview. We love working with people who are always trying to better themselves. Hopefully you will gain a lot of positive experience through this but if not we'd love your feedback</li>
<li>When you're preparing to interview (either with us or someone else), you'll often be sharing stories of your past. A great way to frame this is with the STAR model: Situation, Task, Action, Result. This allows you to succinctly share the experiences you've gained</li>
<li>We're looking for people with a passion for technology. Make sure you invest some time in learning about MongoDB, the industry we operate in, what we offer and how that sets us apart</li>
