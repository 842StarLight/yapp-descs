<h2>Field Research Interviewer - Nielsen TV Ratings - 41122</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>Did you know that 103 million people in the United States watched the biggest football game of the year? Or that 93% of U.S. adults 18 and older listen to radio every week? Here at Nielsen, we produce that data! For over 70 years, our Radio and Television Ratings have played a significant role in providing key information to media and advertising companies.</p>
<p>Our secret recipe for producing the Ratings is to marry technology with people. In order to do that, we have hundreds of Membership Representatives (MRs) across the country recruiting people to participate in our Ratings panels. We are looking for passionate, persuasive and outgoing people to join our teams across the country.</p>
<p><b>What’s it like to work at Nielsen?</b></p>
<p>We want everyone to have a voice and be themselves. Our associates represent the diverse consumers and markets that we measure. We value the diversity of thought, experiences, skills and cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>We believe in making things open, connected, useful and personal. We challenge everyone to innovate, learn new things, take risks, and grow! And we believe in having fun while we work!</p>
<p><b>What does it take to be a Membership Representative?</b></p>
<p>Since we are into research studies at Nielsen, we surveyed our MRs and asked them to describe themselves. The majority responded with goal-driven, personable, adaptable, resilient, self-motivated, influential, hard-working, energetic, friendly, passionate, creative, team-spirited, humble, and gritty. If these words describe you, keep reading!</p>
<p><b>What does a Membership Representative do?</b></p>
<p>Our MRs are the face of Nielsen and truly enjoy interacting with strangers. 90% of our associates feel the highlight of their role is the opportunity to meet a lot of wonderful people while in the field.</p>
<p>Our MRs travel to selected homes, known as Nielsen Families, without an appointment and unannounced. MRs use persuasion skills and techniques to gain cooperation and participation in the Nielsen Ratings. The real world is our office allowing our MRs to be out and about during afternoon and evening hours (3 - 8 pm)and one weekend day, as these are opportune times to connect with prospective panelists when they are most likely to be home.</p>
<p><b>Anything else a Membership Representative brings to the table?</b></p>
<p>We do have a few general requirements. All representatives need a High School Diploma or GED with 2-5 years equivalent work experience (We love college degrees too!). They also need to show proficiency using a tablet &amp; smartphone, e-mails, spreadsheets, and other applications, have a valid driver’s license, car insurance, and a satisfactory driving record.</p>
<p><b>In addition to a really cool career, what are the benefits?</b></p>
<p>We offer benefits you’d expect from an industry-leading company, but at Nielsen, we strive to bring all of the pieces together and focus on the “Whole You.” From health &amp; wellness programs to time off to stock ownership, we want our associates to have a healthy, rewarding, balanced and meaningful experience—both at work and in life. Our comprehensive benefits package is effective day one of employment.</p>
<p><b>I’ve heard Nielsen is a great place to work… is that true?</b></p>
