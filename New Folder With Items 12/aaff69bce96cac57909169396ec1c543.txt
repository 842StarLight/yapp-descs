Chainalytics’ Integrated Demand and Supply Planning Practice (IDSP) assists clients with the executive Integrated Demand &amp; Supply Planning process. We define the executive Integrated Demand &amp; Supply Planning process as a cross-functional business process with a goal of balancing demand and supply as profitably as possible by maintaining one “truth” – that is, one integrated sales and operations plan. In addition, we offer opportunity assessments that focus on improvements available from integrating the planning processes. Our professionals work closely with clients on initiatives to balance demand and supply by helping them design their demand and supply planning processes, overlay enabling technology, and ultimately, implement the executive Integrated Demand &amp; Supply Planning process. The result is improved cost efficiency and service levels for our clients, thus increasing their supply chain’s contribution to added shareholder value and overall business effectiveness.
