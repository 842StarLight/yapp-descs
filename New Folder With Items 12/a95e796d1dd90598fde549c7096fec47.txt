You will have the opportunity to mentor members of the development team regarding your area of expertise, and to become a subject-matter expert.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You will have a large influence on the direction of the UI-products and lifecycle. Initial projects include migrating our current UI products from AngularJS to Angular, in addition to new product development.
