<div><b>The Company</b></div>
<div>
Clarify is building the brains of the digital healthcare system of the future - developing real-time AI-analytics and care guidance solutions that improve the lives of patients and of those who care for them. The company’s founders include the former Senior Partner and head of McKinsey’s global Healthcare IT and Digital Practice and the former Chief Technology officer of Advent Software.</div>

</div>
<div>
An early stage company, with KKR leading its B investment round in late 2018, Clarify is based in San Francisco and has an office in New York. The company is focused on three healthcare industry customer segments: Providers (e.g. hospitals), Payers (e.g. health insurers) and Life Sciences (e.g. pharmaceutical companies). Revenues consist of a mix of recurring Software-as-a-Service fees and one-time consulting/implementation fees, with the heaviest emphasis on the former. Clarify, a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Qualified Entity, has over 200 million lives in its database, has amassed one of the largest pools of healthcare data in the United States and provides access to customer-specific analytical insights into that data, with customer pricing varying in accordance with the frequency, sophistication and interactivity of customer access to that analysis.</div>

Reporting to the Senior Director, Corporate Controller, the Accounting Manager will help build an accounting and financial reporting function that will not only grow with the company but that will ultimately be capable of taking Clarify through the IPO process and into public company status. We are looking for someone who has the ability to create policies, processes and systems that are right for our stage, who can positively team with external and internal partners, and has a growth mindset. Experience both in high-growth startups and Software as a Service (SaaS) companies will be extremely helpful.</div>
