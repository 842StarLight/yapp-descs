<p><b>COMPANY SUMMARY:</b></p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>
McCann Health Echo is a full-service healthcare advertising agency solely focused on healthcare professionals and their patients. There is a sweet spot that exists at the intersection of HCP and patient – a conversation that happens, which paves the way for treatment plans and goals – and that’s where we live. We build smart, original brands and present ideas that delight and inspire our partners, encouraging them to reach further to connect with the consumer and reimagine healthcare.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>
We are a collection of naturally creative, instinctively insightful, and authentically strategic people who care deeply about brands and one another. Our vibe is genuine and relaxed – more backyard barbecue than boardroom. We pride ourselves on being independent but inclusive, down-to-earth but driven.</p>

Standing behind us at all times is McCann Health, the largest global agency network. McCann Health is a part of McCann Worldgroup and the Interpublic Group (NYSE: IPG).</p>
