<p>
Whether you're on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product's journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you'll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>
<p>
In this role, you will lead our global agency marketing strategy for our large agency partners, working closely with the global sales team (GCAS). You will be the dedicated marketing leader to craft, build and execute our marketing plan for this audience by uncovering new insights, performing industry analysis and balancing business needs with creative thinking to help turn regional/local approaches into a global plan. You'll apply your creative ideas with a broad range of novel insights to help agencies fully leverage the potential of our platforms to drive growth for their clients. You'll balance strategic big-thinking with systematic problem-solving and day-to-day executional skills. You will focus on scaling successful programs across markets, developing global systems to help local teams execute efficiently. You will use storytelling and press outlets to bring to life our core agency narratives in a highly dynamic landscape. You will bring a customer-first mindset to help break down internal silos across SMB and LCS, Global and Local, Google and YouTube.</p>

And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can-changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>
