<p>“Software is Eating the World” and we're Happy About It. Marc Andreessen was right when he said that almost a decade ago, in fact it's truer today than it was then. Companies need to prove their worth. They need to build strong cultures, delight their customers, and establish their own competitive advantages. One of the ways they are doing that is turning to Salesforce as a development platform. As awesome as Salesforce is (we are entirely built on the native platform) there are many gaps in the tools utilized for Salesforce development. Teams struggle with outdated, cobbled-together solutions. Most dev-ops vendors were leveraging the tools built for traditional development platforms and did not handle the unique needs of the Salesforce platform, causing great inefficiencies and frustrations. So we built Flosum. About Us Flosum helps hundreds of companies of all shapes and sizes efficiently and effectively manage their Salesforce development needs. The Flosum team now spans seven time zones and supports clients at some of the top companies in the world. Our solution has garnered praise and top awards from users and organizations alike. We help developers that have focused on the most important CRM platform deliver their apps securely and consistently.</p>
