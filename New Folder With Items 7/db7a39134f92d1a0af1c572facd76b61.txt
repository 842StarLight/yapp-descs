<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>
Service Legends is more than just a Heating and Cooling Company - we are a big family and all we’re missing is you! Here at Service Legends we firmly believe you should enjoy where you work and who you work with, and that’s something we take seriously. Our office environment is a little different than most, we certainly work hard but we also like to have fun, play games, and encourage one another to step outside of our comfort zone.</p>
<p>
Your work family is important, but we understand that your personal family is even more so. We are committed to not only our team members’ professional development but also their personal growth. We always encourage a healthy work-life balance. Our team members are challenged to design their own path to advancement within the company, and we help them achieve those goals with support and guidance every step of the way.</p>
<p>
Not to brag, but Service Legends was a 2016 recipient of the Des Moines Register’s Top Place to Work! We love taking care of our clients and we take great pride in going above and beyond for our team members as well. We’re proud to be a leader in heating and cooling the Des Moines area. We specialize in installs, maintenance and repairs for furnaces, air conditioners and more. Having served the Des Moines area since 1997 (with legendary service by the way), it’s safe to say we’ve earned a PhD in keeping you comfy.</p>
