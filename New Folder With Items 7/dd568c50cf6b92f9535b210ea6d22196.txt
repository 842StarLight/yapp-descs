<h2>Data Science - Generalist & Machine Learning Engineer - Full Time Opportunities</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><ul>Wayfair's Data Science team builds the algorithmic systems that drive our business.<br>
<br>
With 8 expansive workstreams (Pricing, Personalization &amp; Recommendations, Merchandising, Marketing, Measurement, B2B, Computer Vision, and Operations), and more than 20 specialized subteams, our projects span from enormously broad to minutely specific. The projects that our teams work on are driven from the ground up - we look for entrepreneurial individuals that want to take ownership over their own agenda and thrive in a collaborative team environment. Take for example (1) determining how to implement AR technology to improve the shopping experience<br>
<br>
versus (2) optimizing diversity in the sales we highlight in a customer's email. There is very little at Wayfair that our Data Science team does not touch. They work closely with stakeholders across the business to ensure that our data driven insights do not collect dust. With an in-house A/B testing platform and rolling code deployments, our team can quickly and clearly see the impact that its work has on the company at large.<br>
