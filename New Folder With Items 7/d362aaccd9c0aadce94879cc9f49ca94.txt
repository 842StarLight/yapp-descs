<h2>Vice President Enterprise Contact Center</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p></p>
<div>The Enterprise Contact Center Vice President’s primary responsibility is to ensure the delivery of an optimal experience for members interacting with the credit union via phone, email, chat, sms/txt, mail or any other related interaction. This includes direct responsibility of all main member service inquiries and consumer loan applications as well as coordination with other internal departments to ensure an optimal experience via related channels for other interactions to include mortgage and business lending, collections, investments, insurance, payments, fraud, etc.
<br>
<br>
This role requires a unique combination of skills to include the ability to provide leadership and coaching, both directly and indirectly, to a large group of personnel (200+ employees) along with the technical and operational understanding to lead process improvement for both employees and members necessary to provide the most efficient and effective service.
<br>
<br>
Personnel leadership requires a focus on employee engagement as well as the ability to effectively ensure coaching and development of the team at all levels including managers, assistant managers and specialists in line with organizational practices and values. This includes a focus on succession planning at all levels within the Contact Center to ensure development of staff for roles both in the Contact Center and other departments within the credit union.
<br>
<br>
Comprehensive technical and operational leadership is required to understand how advanced technology systems can be leveraged and improved with two distinct focuses: employee and member-facing experiences. Employees need simple tools to quickly service member inquiries to provide faster handle times, higher first-contact resolution, simplified training requirements, improved service through focus on relationship over systems, and ultimately higher employee satisfaction. Member-facing improvements require the use of technology to provide seamless contact experiences through effective and frictionless authentication, advanced intent analysis, and integrating computer-assisted and human-assisted responses and service based on the unique attributes of the member and related request(s). In addition to using traditional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and other phone systems, the Enterprise Contact Center Vice President must understand how Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine-learning and Robotics Process Automation (RPA) can maximize efficiency, service and the overall experience for both employees and member-facing interactions. Ultimately, these tools must be considered as part of building both a short and long-term strategic plan, in partnership with IT and other internal departments, to ensure progress is made toward the desired end state in line with VyStar’s goals and objectives.
<br>
<br>
In addition to leveraging technology, the Enterprise Contact Center VP must build feedback mechanisms to monitor member and employee feedback related to issues and pain points, and champion process improvement with related internal departments to remove friction from related interactions, as well as simplify the employee experience when servicing member inquiries.
<br>
<br>
The Enterprise Contact Center VP must also work with internal department heads of other departments that work with members via related contact methods to provide a consistent and simple experience for all interactions.
<br>
<br>
Creates an environment of empowerment at all levels of the Contact Center, where risk-taking and ownership is encouraged. Ensures compliance of all applicable regulations, policies, procedures and statutes.
