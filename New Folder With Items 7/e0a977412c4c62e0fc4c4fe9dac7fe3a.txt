<p><b>Q&amp;A WITH ARMANINO CORPORATE TAX PARTNER-IN-CHARGE, DAVID SORDELLO</b></p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><b>
What is Armanino’s culture like in the San Jose office?</b></p>
<p></p>
<br>
<div><i>
“We are very focused on having a team-oriented practice and collaborative work environment. The Partners are heavily involved in the day-to-day activities of the clients and work closely with everybody from the Directors down to the Staff. We also believe it’s important to have a healthy work-life balance and to help achieve that, we provide a lot of flexibility in terms of how you get your work done.”</i></div>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><b>
Why is this a good opportunity for a Tax Manager/Senior Manager coming from the Big 4 or a regional firm?</b></p>
<p></p>
<br>
<div><i>
“We’re a smaller, alternate path to the Big 4 which means we have the ability to take care of people individually instead of in teams (Big 4 structure). At Armanino we can help each person determine where they want to be and help them get there at their own pace. We try and push for advancement as much as we can if that’s what the person wants, but it’s certainly not an “up and out” mentality.</i></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
We have a lot of depth. We service the same clients that the Big 4 and other firms do, but we are a lot more flexible than the Big 4 in terms of allowing each person to take control of their career.<br>
</i></div>
<p></p>
<p><i>We also want people to see that there are immense advancement opportunities here. We’re not governed by bureaucracy in terms of "how many Partners can we make each year".<br>
</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>We don’t have a lot of those constraints. We're driven by business and not by a National Office. The Partners have a lot more autonomy and a chance to be more individualistic in how their career works. They have a say in what opportunities there are for people, and can create those opportunities.”</i></p>
<p></p>
<br>
<div><b>
What will this person’s future look like at Armanino and what are a few of the most important intangibles they need to have, in order to be successful in this position?</b></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
“In some ways we are like a Big 4 firm because we’re trying to push people along in their careers and help get them to the Partner level.<br>
</i></div>
<div></div>
<div><i>However, I don’t think the term “Partner” means the same thing to everyone. There’s a lot of diversity in our Partner group and there’s no one size fits all Partner. There are some that have more work-life balance, some that work a ton, and there are some in the middle. We have roles for many different Partners in this practice and that provides flexibility in what type of people can make Partner.</i></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
At the same time if someone is at that point of their career where that’s not what they want, there’s flexibility to stay at a level if that’s where they will be the happiest.<br>
</i></div>
<div></div>
<div><i>In order to be a successful in this role, there needs to be a desire to continuously learn as you grow. If this person enjoys challenging situations and is entrepreneurial, they’ll be extremely successful in this firm.”</i></div>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><b>
Why do clients choose Armanino over the competition?</b></p>
<p></p>
<br>
<div><i>
“There are four main reasons, among many others:</i></div>
<ul><li><i>
Higher level of service – we don’t push our work down to the Seniors and Managers. The Partner or Director is going to have more involvement in all aspects of the project.</i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>
Quality of service – We’re a very consultative practice and a lot of it’s geared around what our clients want and how we deliver the services.</i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>
Attention and responsiveness – we are structured so that our Partners can respond to clients in a timely manner and be proactive versus reactive.</i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>
Depth of services – when we are not competing with the Big 4, there’s nobody else around that can compete. We’re in some ways a Big 4 boutique practice that can actually go out and serve the clients with more senior level resources.”</i></li></ul>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><b>
WHY A BIG 4 PARTNER CHOSE ARMANINO TAX</b></p>
<p></p>
<br>
<div><i>
“I was at a Big 4 firm for 17 years where I started at the Staff level and eventually made Partner. I was one of many who knew little about Armanino at that time. I don’t think people understand the money you can make, the type of clients you can work on, and variety the projects that you can have at our firm.
</i></div>
<p><i>The reason I left the Big 4 ultimately came down the fact that it became too bureaucratic and National Office driven. For somebody that wanted to be entrepreneurial, it was really hard to do that in an environment that is so structured and restrictive. Even as a Partner you were stuck in this box. I saw an opportunity to create something at Armanino so I took it.”</i></p>
