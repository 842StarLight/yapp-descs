<p><b>
Qualifications</b></p>
<p>
Required Experience and Skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>High School Diploma</li>
<li>Ability to type at least 65 WPM with 95% accuracy</li>
<li>Proficient with the Google Suite and Microsoft Excel</li>
<li>Driven, self-starter who is naturally curious and wants to understand our industry</li>
<li>Excellent interpersonal skills - can communicate clearly and intelligently with co-workers and customers</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute professionalism. Internally Shareworks Startup is and feels like everything you would expect from a startup; but every interaction with clients needs to be fast, professional, succinct, and intelligent.</li>
<li>You will often be managing multiple conversations at once, some of which will require you to follow up with clients in the future (for example, when a bug has been fixed). We need someone who won’t let details fall through the cracks.</li>
<li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills, as well as problem solving skills.</li>
<li>Strong computer skills and confidence in learning new programs. You will be using Excel a lot - Excel skills are a must.</li>
<li>Self Starter. It’s cliché, but as a startup we don’t have the resources to micromanage you, we need someone who can be very productive with almost no oversight.</li>
<li>Strong Math Competency. You should be extremely comfortable with general algebra.</li>
<li>Since your work will be primarily client facing, we need to be able to rely on you during business hours (ideally we’re looking for someone from 8 - 5, but would be open to earlier hours).</li>
</ul>
<p>Preferred Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor’s Degree</li>
<li>Basic accounting/finance understanding. Shareworks Startup shares many qualities with accounting software like Quickbooks; an understanding of accounting principles like ledgers, basic P&amp;L’s, etc. will go a long way in learning the system.</li>
<li>Interest in Startups/Tech/Finance. Our team loves the startup community, and real interest in the space is huge.</li>
<li>General understanding of cap tables. We don’t expect you to have deep understanding of equity administration, but any general understanding of equity terms (stock, dividends, capital fund-raising, cap table, etc) would be a large advantage.</li>
</ul>
