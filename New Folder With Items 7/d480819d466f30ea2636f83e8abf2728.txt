Are you looking to join an innovative technology company while building a career in sales? Do you want to work with a solution that is transforming how enterprises train &amp; evaluate their workforce? You might be saying to yourself, “Okay that sounds great but what would I be selling?” Great question. Let’s start with the problem we solve first. Traditional eLearning and training courses are mostly passive, not allowing for students to practice. There is a lot of showing, but not much doing. Trainees do not have the opportunity to perform the procedures. Live sessions allow that but are expensive, hard to schedule and not scalable.</p>
<p>
Heartwood’s 3D Simulations &amp; Guides empowers workforce to practice on virtual equipment and procedures that is replicated in form &amp; function, allowing them to ‘learn-by-doing’. This, in turn, reduces training costs, accelerates employee learning and decreases expensive live training by being Visual, Interactive and Portable.</p>
