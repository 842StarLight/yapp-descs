Essential Functions</b>
</p>Researches, analyzes, designs, and tests component parts, processes, or systems to develop new and/or improve core products. Develops and recommends solutions to engineering requirements for complex or specialized projects or systems, to ensure that design objectives are met, including program scope, cost and schedule constraints. Applies engineering principles based on assigned engineering domain (e.g. mechanical; electrical; chemical, etc.) 1. Develops conceptual and detailed product specifications by analyzing performance and customer requirements. Investigates design factors such as function, materials, performance, interchangeability, cost (non‚Äêrecurring and recurring), operational efficiency, and contractual requirements. May develop preliminary designs from customer input and descriptive information provided by others. 2. Applies scientific analysis and mathematical models to predict and measure the outcome and consequence of design alternatives. Interprets and validates test results for accuracy and precision. Recommends product qualification procedures and parameters to achieve customer and product reliability and safety standards (e.g. failure analysis). May utilize and interpret predictive models to simulate and verify design concepts. 3. Provides technical information for review with product engineering teams using established engineering practices, standards, and documentation methods (e.g. structured design process; customer design reviews). Writes supporting documentation for procedures and technical reports; may write technical responses or proposals for customers. 4. Contributes to the completion milestones associated with specific projects (e.g. create functional diagrams and system layouts; review detailed drawings and schematics; define data structure, interfaces and programming logic; analyze material requirements; research customer data item requirements). Maintain efforts within defined cost and schedule constraints including stat using and root cause/corrective actions of associated variances. May act as a Control Account Manager (CAM) for projects applying Earned Value Management (EVM). 5. Reviews product specifications to ensure clarity, completeness, form, fit, function, and conformity to standards and procedures. Identifies design errors, omissions, and other deficiencies, and recommends revisions, engineering change orders, and improvements to engineering management or the project team. 6. Maintains and further develops professional and technical knowledge by attending educational workshops, reviewing technical publications, and/or participating in professional associations. 7. Shares specialized knowledge with others. Assigned to mentor new employees. May represent the company on specific projects or engineering tasks. 8. Must have ability to deal with people at a cross-functional level. Position requires ability to effectively communicate in oral and written form to present information and respond to inquiries from employees, customers, suppliers and including up line to manager when matters require higher visibility. 9. Ability to effectively interface with customers and drive solidification of product specifications Works with engineering project or a cross-functional team within the business unit; may have regular customer/suppler interaction. 10. Experienced working in cross functional teams consisting of various disciplines which may include project managers, supply chain, quality, manufacturing, electrical engineers, software engineers, test engineers and others as required by projects.<p><b>
