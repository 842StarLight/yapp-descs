<h2>Advertising Consultant</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>Hello, and welcome to our quest to find our newest Advertising Consultant to add to our awesome sales team here at SN&amp;R! Hang out, put on your employer-provided office slippers and stick around for a while. This is the magical land where creative ideas and strong coffee flow like the Wonka chocolate river, and popcorn, giggles and mayhem may just show up right when you need them the most. Don't worry... we have a complimentary all-access gym membership at Capital Athletic Club with your name on it, too. You know, if that is your thing, of course. We know how to be serious, too... seriously.</p>
<p><b>Us: </b></p>
<p>We are a family owned independent media company and our Sacramento paper just celebrated our 30th anniversary! Our mission is to publish great newspapers which are successful and enduring, create a quality work environment that encourages growth while respecting personal welfare, and to have a positive impact on our communities and makes them better places to live.</p>
<p>We are proud to celebrate and exercise inclusion, free thinking, and equal opportunities in all aspects of our company structure. We prioritize creating workplaces that reflect the diversity within the communities we serve and where everyone can be their true, authentic self.</p>
<p>We like to have fun. We are keen on creative variances on high fives and secret handshakes. We are suckers for great local music, caffeine, cold beer on a hot day, and the occasional dip in the river. We play nice in sandboxes and usually try to avoid running with scissors. Our team cares deeply about our partnerships with the local business communities, and we can't do any of it without you, our newest Advertising Consultant.</p>
<p><b>You: </b></p>
<p>You are on the hunt for an opportunity unlike your last, where you can flex a bit of marketing and customer service muscle, work closely with passionate local business owners and talented account managers, and perhaps have a laugh or three in the process.</p>
<p>You are self-directed, big on little details and follow-through, and super comfortable reaching out to the unknown. You are a proactive communicator who loves discovering how businesses set themselves apart from the competition, and an active listener who, and this is an important one, is a completely at home with finding often unique and creative advertising solutions for a variety of companies. It is your happy place.</p>
<p>Our new Advertising Consultant, above all, is a solid cultural fit. Sure, this position requires ambition, work ethic, dependability, organization and superior customer service skills. One has to have a solid footing in the worlds of market research and community engagement, AND equally must understand and be committed to the work we perform and the people involved. A lot of one's waking weekday time is spent in offices, on phones, in front of computers and behind wheels... we take that seriously and want to make sure those hours are fulfilling and meaningful to the great folks we proudly call our colleagues.</p>
<p><b>Requirements: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Two years in business, retail, customer service or related field</li>
<li>Outside sales or business development is a huge plus</li>
<li>An understanding of what makes a great advertisement</li>
<li>Direct experience engaging with our paper and a solid understanding of our editorial and advertising content</li>
<li>College degree is preferred, but totally not a deal-breaker</li>
<li>Daily access to a personal vehicle, license to operate that vehicle, and insurance just in case the operation of that vehicle doesn't go so well</li>
</ul>
