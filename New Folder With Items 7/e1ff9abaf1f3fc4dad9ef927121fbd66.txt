Your Opportunity
</b></p>
<p>Are you passionate about helping organizations build high performance applications and services? Do you want to give New Relic customers unprecedented visibility into how their services are performing? Do you want to deeply understand and serve the needs of the Java community and ecosystem?</p>
<p>
New Relic is looking for an experienced, customer-facing product manager to own the strategy for our Java/JVM community. New Relic’s agent monitors services written in Java, Scala, Kotlin, and others so that our customers understand how their services are performing and pinpoint the source of latency, errors, and other problems.</p>
<p>
Our customers rely on our application data collection software to give them complete visibility into their application and services. New Relic’s agent runs inside customers’ services, which means we have a relentless focus on reliability, efficiency, and stability. At the same time, we strive to provide customers with complete control and customization of what and how they monitor in their services.</p>
<p>
We seek product managers who have strong opinions, loosely held, and have a constant thirst to learn. On the Application Data Collection team, you will collaborate closely with and learn from your peers that oversee other programming language communities.</p>
<p>
You will be a core leader in the team responsible for driving product strategy and vision, relations with customers and our partner ecosystem, working with Engineering and User Experience to deliver breakthrough products, and growing the business in partnership with Marketing, Sales, and Customer Success teams. To connect well across these different functions and distributed teams, and to meet with customers, a few days of monthly travel will be expected.</p>
