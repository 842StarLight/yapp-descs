Description<div>
</div>
<div>
The Aerial Layer R&amp;D<b> </b>(ALR&amp;D) lab's mission is to experiment, mature, and apply leading edge aerial networking technologies to solve system integration and operational issues and influence concepts and capabilities for the next generation tactical data networks, including A2/AD. Our facility includes both unclassified and classified lab spaces and radio rooms. We offer a collaborative environment with network connections to other MITRE, government, and vendor labs. The lab is equipped with tactical data terminals (Link 16, SADL), IP-based terminals (TTNT, Mini CDL, PRC-117G), and several models of UHF/VHF radios (PRC-117F, PRC-152, URC-200) capable of a variety of tactical waveforms. The lab also maintains several tactical data link gateways, modeling and simulation tools (MATLAB, STK, OPNET, AFSIM), and networking and radio test equipment. A fleet of mobile systems (trailer and truck-based shelters) provide a scaled down version of the lab for field experimentation and demonstration.<br>

<div>The ALR&amp;D Lab has been at the forefront of the evolution of aerial networking and tactical data networking technologies. Prototype systems, such as the Multi-Link Translation and Display System, have influenced the current TDN products on the marketplace today. Current research is defining future aerial networking capabilities and assessing the technologies needed to operate in contested environments. Work is ongoing in critical sponsor program areas such as Common Data Link (CDL), Tactical Air Control Party TACP, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS). Technology research in areas such as RF cosite, nulling antennas, and aerial networking coverage provide sponsors with in-depth technical information to support critical acquisition decisions.<br>
