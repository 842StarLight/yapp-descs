<h2>Account Executive</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Want to be a part of a small but fast-growing mobile technology company?
<br><br>
APPrise Mobile is an enterprise mobile SaaS company, and our product, theEMPLOYEEapp, is used by our client companies to communicate with and drive engagement with their employees, the vast majority of who do not use desktop computers as part of their work. Believe it or not, there are 2.4 billion “deskless workers” in the global workforce and, up until now, technologies have not catered to them. However, because of the proliferation of mobile technology, this is no longer the case.
<br><br>
APPrise Mobile is leading the way in defining this new category of communications technology for the deskless worker. We were recently selected as a “Cool Vendor” in the digital workplace by Gartner and are selling theEMPLOYEEapp software to the enterprise.
