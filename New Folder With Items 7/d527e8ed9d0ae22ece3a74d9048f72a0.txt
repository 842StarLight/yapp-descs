<h2>Director, Product Excellence</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">WHO WE ARE
<br><br>
One third of the world's food goes to waste. Which means all the water, energy, and greenhouse gases used to produce that food is wasted with it. This is a problem with a $990 billion price tag for the food industry and an even bigger one for the planet. But we believe the solution is simple.
<br><br>
What if we could eliminate waste by better balancing the supply and demand of food?
<br><br>
Zume uses predictive analytics and real-time food consumption data to predict customer demand, match it with production, and enable food companies to make smarter decisions across the food supply chain.
<br><br>
By connecting all the pieces of the food supply chain, we enable our partners to make better decisions for their business, their customers, and the planet we all call home.
<br><br>
We're tackling some of the world's biggest problems, and we need your help to solve them. If you want to take on something different in your career, we'd love to meet you.
