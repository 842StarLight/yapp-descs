 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">About Instabase
<br><br>
Founded in 2015, Instabase's mission is to advance the state of the art by building tools that help people solve important problems, make discoveries, and create new breakthroughs.
<br><br>
Instabase is an operating system designed for operational efficiency. It uses the web browser as the user interface, a pluggable storage system for managing data (files and databases), and an app store for applications. These applications run on the Instabase Platform, which provides the core management capabilities for managing diverse, distributed datasets; support for collaboration and access control; and a runtime for Instabase Applications.
<br><br>
The applications include state of the art tools for [1] processing a diverse set of unstructured data (scanned images, PDFs, word/excel documents, emails, websites, etc.), [2] running extensible functions with a server-less framework, [3] machine learning (natural language processing, image processing, classification, clustering, etc.), and [4] data science.
<br><br>
Our customers include large enterprises with huge operational costs in a variety of domains, such as financial services (e.g. banks, insurance), healthcare, logistics/supply chain.
<br><br>
As a non-profit initiative, Instabase provides a hosted IPython-style notebook for education, which is widely used by universities (Stanford, MIT, Columbia, University of Chicago, etc.), for teaching classes.
