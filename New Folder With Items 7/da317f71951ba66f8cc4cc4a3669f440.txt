Data-driven decision making. You ground yourself in insights and data to be the voice of the customer. Only some of this data may be readily available, so enthusiasm and initiative are just as important as smarts!</li>

Passion. You want to help build great products and user experiences and have the ability to inspire passion in others to create a shared vision.</li>

Responsibilities</b></p>
<p>
As a product management associate in the HP Healthcare Solutions team you will:</p>
<p>
Gather customer insights and market research that will guide decisions on the experiences we want to deliver to healthcare providers globally, the specific product requirements needed to support those experiences and how we prioritize our resources appropriately. Support the development of business cases and market models to create buy-in for these product and solution concepts. Help design and manage proof of concepts with healthcare customers that demonstrate the benefits of our solutions. Done right, this can open up opportunities to present the findings at industry events, while also generating insights to improve the next generation of solutions. Identify and drive relationships with hardware and software business partners whose products, when integrated or bundled with HP’s healthcare solutions, will offer significant workflow efficiencies to our healthcare customers. Partner internally across functional groups (such as R&amp;D, Legal, Marketing and category and sales teams) to bring these solutions to market and track their business performance. Develop narratives for these solutions that you and the HP Marketing team can use to create (or refine) sales training materials and solution briefs for customers.</p>
