<h2>Inside Sales Executive</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>Have you ever imagined what it’d be like to see who’s visiting your company’s website?</p>
<p>Lead Forensics made that imagination a reality 10 years ago and we’ve since become one of the fastest growing software companies globally.</p>
<p>Our SaaS (Software as a Service) solution gives a business the ability to see what other businesses are looking at their website, their journeys and importantly, the products or services they didn’t enquire about.</p>
<p>Why does this matter?</p>
<p>Well, businesses are like you when it comes to purchases. If you’re looking for a specific item, for example a new car, then you’ll take the time to research the market, find where the best deals are and where’s going to offer what you’re looking for. This doesn’t always mean that you’ll buy the first car that you’ve seen.</p>
<p>So, if the showroom already knew what kind of car you were looking for, the price range and any additional features, then they’d have a stronger chance of success when it comes to that initial conversation with you, would you agree?</p>
<p>We know that every B2B business will benefit from the leads our product provides and coming in as a Sales Executive, you’ll be the one to help us show them how.</p>
<p>As an Inside Sales Executive, you’ll be tasked with contacting prospective clients, speaking to C-Level Executives to explain and demonstrate this incredible tool. Initially you’ll be contacting them by phone, with the demonstration then being conducted online.</p>
<p>Once the online demonstration’s done and the prospect qualification is complete, you’ll be responsible for the product evaluation which again is completed online. Due to this, you’ll need experience within a full 360 sales environment, ideally B2B.</p>
<p>Professionalism and rapport building will be your forte. You’ll have a winning mentality and a drive to maximise your sales conversions.</p>
<p>In turn, we’ll provide you with a goal orientated environment for life-long learning. A place where you can develop and forge your own destiny. We embrace change, always support people through their own growth and challenge the status quo daily.</p>
<p>We encourage an autonomous nature through our core DNA company values.</p>
<p>So, what will you get in return?</p>
<ul>
<li>A competitive salary.</li>
<li>Uncapped commission, not only on new business but renewals each year.</li>
<li>Incentives such as quarterly trips for top performers.</li>
<li>Performance based quarterly salary increases.</li>
<li>Career progression that’s target driven.</li>
<li>Training provided by experienced in-house L&amp;D teams.</li>
<li>PTO allowances that increase yearly PLUS…your birthday off.</li>
<li>Medical, Dental &amp; Life Insurance, as well as 401k.</li>
<li>Plenty of social events such as Christmas parties, quarterly team outings and charity days.</li>
<li>A chance to be part of a highly dynamic, positive, fast paced team where you’ve got the opportunity to make a big difference.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll get so much more but there’s only so much that can be voiced on paper. For that reason, let’s have a chat (confidential of course).</p>
