<div>If the phrase “everything is sourcing, and sourcing is everything” resonates with you, then you should check us out. This is a chance to join a talent team that truly values the sourcing function and is looking for a real-live professional sourcer as our foundational talent hire in Denver.</div>

Snapdocs is an early-stage, rapidly growing company backed by investors like Sequoia, SV Angel, and YCombinator. We are tackling the massive mortgage market, developing modern software for an industry that still relies on fax machines and manila envelopes. We bring security, efficiency, and joy to a paper-based pillar of the US economy. As we expand our product offering and tackle a broader swath of customers, we need to grow our team with smart, hungry, and curious people. That’s where you come in...</div>

We are now looking for a great Denver-based startup sourcer to drive the next phase of our growth both here and in San Francisco. In this role, you will truly partner with the business, working closely with our recruiters and hiring managers to understand and calibrate requirements and then find and engage the best possible folks across a wide variety of roles from engineering and product to sales and marketing to infosec. You’ll own candidate pipeline, researching until you find the best of the best and then crafting customized messaging to get their attention. As our first dedicated sourcer, you’ll work closely with the Head of Talent to continuously iterate and optimize our top-of-funnel process, tools, and candidate experience. And as an early member of our Denver team, you’ll have a huge role to play in building and evangelizing Snapdocs’ presence in The Mile High City.</div>

Our ideal candidate is someone with real sourcing experience and a very consultative nature. No matter where you earned your sourcing stripes, you’ve developed a knack for spotting talent from a mile away, reading between the lines on a resume or profile, and getting the attention of folks who have a dozen other recruitment messages in their inbox. What will set you apart from run of the mill sourcers is creativity. You’re sourcing radar is always on and you realize there are myriad places to find candidates outside of LinkedIn. And of course you’re a startup person. Even though we’re ~100 now, heading to 200 with a bullet, we’re still small and scrappy so your strong sense of pragmatism will be key in this role.</div>

Snapdocs’ culture is one that strongly values diversity and drive. We want to work with people of different backgrounds and different paths in life. We provide a range of excellent benefits ranging from the standard stuff (4% match on 401(k), free lunches, 21 days PTO!) to the not so standard (10 year exercise window on your options!!) and our location in the heart of the downtown Denver is super convenient.</div>
