<b>Description:</b><br>
Michelson Found Animals Adopt &amp; Shop is a unique store with a mission – Saving Pets. Enriching Lives. We offer pet adoptions, pet supplies, grooming and dog daycare, all in one location. All of our pets come from local shelters and as a nonprofit, all of the sales go back into programs to save more pets. Join us in making a difference for pets and pet owners!
<br><br>
<b>Your Role with Us:</b><br>
We are not your ordinary non-profit. We prefer to think of ourselves as an innovative and mission-driven social enterprise. If you can’t tell by now - we like to think outside of the box. And if you do too, we’ll probably be a great match. We are just regular people that have an extreme passion for pets and an idea to change the world for them.
<br><br>
In this role you’ll get to interact with a lot of people, pets, and personalities. But that’s okay, because that’s what makes you thrive. You can handle a lot of things coming at you at once. You’re probably really good at whack-a-mole. We expect you will work hard and play hard. Collaboration is the way we work best. We believe that a multitude of creative minds working together makes all the difference. .
