<div>
The Partner ecosystem presents an amazing opportunity for WalkMe to distribute the platform through companies who need it the most.

As an ISV &amp; Alliances Operations Director, you will report to the VP of Partner ISV &amp; Alliances in NAM. Your primary responsibility will be to build a global, scalable and accessible technology marketplace where ISV partners can build integrations to WalkMe. As part of that you will liaison with the Product and Development organizations to ensure that partners have a simple way to use or embed WalkMe in their SaaS products. The size of the partner ecosystem will require you to build operational processes that make the experience easy for the partner. This includes and is not limited to managing the partner website and exchange, communication to partners about the programs in place and supporting partners with their operational or technology needs. Your work enables the Sales and the Business Development teams to achieve their go to market, pipeline generation and booking targets which is how you will be measured. Consider how large Salesforce AppExchange and Microsoft Partner Network have become and that's just for their applications. Now imagine one marketplace or exchange that brings together ANY ISV application. This will take an experienced and creative person who has the vision mixed with operational skills to put the foundation in place.</div>
