The Occasions Group grew out of the deep strength and broad experience of Taylor Corporation, our parent company. We've evolved and grown from the initial acquisition in 1975 of Carlson Wedding Service (now Carlson Craft) in Mankato, MN.</p>
<p>
Our roots began in the wholesale market through Carlson Craft, and since then we have developed capabilities to go to market through multiple channels. And since then we have strategically acquired or built additional facilities in North America, including locations in Sunman, Indiana; Rexburg, Idaho; and Waco, Texas.<br>
