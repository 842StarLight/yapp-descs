<h2>Executive Director – Product Marketing</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">As a product marketing leader at SonicWall, you are ultimately responsible for making SonicWall products "fly-off the shelf."
<br><br>
This role is not about doing demos or presenting product features (although these may sometimes occur). Rather, this role is the glue that binds our product strategy to the tactics we need to drive success in sales and marketing and to achieve results. You will be a product evangelist and will play an integral role in organizing product launches.
<br><br>
<b>You know our competitors like the back of your hand:</b> what they do today and what they plan to do in the future. You also know our buyers better than they know themselves, including how they make their buying decisions. This isn't guesswork. You are the main point of contact for our industry analysts and you bring the knowledge and insight that you gain from this relationship back into the organization. You back up strategic insights with market evidence and then use that knowledge to drive the development of positioning and messaging that resonates with buyers and empowers our sales channels to be successful.
<br><br>
You will collaborate with our corporate marketing team to develop innovative programs that drive demand. An attention to detail and eye for quality are critical to your success, along with an ability to grasp and present our product/portfolio value proposition in a way that resonates and clearly articulates how we solve our customers' problems. You are obsessed with tracking performance, and have the data to prove what's working and what isn't.
<br><br>
In addition to the marketing team, you will regularly collaborate with product management, sales and our channel partners; it's a balancing act that requires strong diplomatic skills, including knowing when to push back and when to dive in.
<br><br>
<b>Key Responsibilities:</b><br>

<li>Market intelligence: Be the expert on the market and our buyers – who are they, how they buy and their key buying criteria. Understand and document our buyer's process, including where they get information, and the who, what, when and why behind the decisions they make. Combine this with what our industry analysts are saying for greater context. Then drive changes to our sales and marketing processes based on what you learn.</li>
<li>Understand the competitive landscape: Be an expert on our competition and our potential competition and how they are positioned – not just and a product-to-product level, but at a corporate level (e.g., why did Company X just acquire Company Y, and what are the implications).</li>
<li>Collaborate with product management, corporate marketing and marketing communications to develop product positioning and messaging that resonates with our target buyer personas.</li>
<li>Develop marketing plans for the products you support in conjunction with our corporate marketing team, including key activities and budgets to support the retention of existing customers and the acquisition of new customers.</li>
<li>Assess the effectiveness of marketing programs that support your products on an ongoing basis by working with the Marketing Operations team, and report back to the business on required changes (e.g., strong focus on ROI-tracking, and being able to clearly prove what is –or isn't—working)</li>
<li>Product launches: Plan the launches of net-new products and releases of existing products, and manage the cross-functional implementation of the plan.</li>
<li>Thought leadership: Act as the primary thought leader for the products you support externally, including speaking engagements and written works. Must be a strong public speaker, comfortable in front of large, senior groups, and a solid writer.</li>
