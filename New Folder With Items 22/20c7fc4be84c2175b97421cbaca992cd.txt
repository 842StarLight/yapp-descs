<div>Job Description<br>
<br>
<p>We are hiring SDRs (Sales Development Representatives) who can work closely with experienced Account Executives!</p>
<p>
This is a typical biz dev/lead gen job for a small fast-growing company, so all the usual duties apply. Day to day that means:</p>

<li><p>
Contacting potential clients through cold calls and emails</p></li>
<li><p>
Setting up meetings or calls between prospective clients and Account Executives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
We are looking for exceptional, driven individuals. We can train the skills and we are looking for unique minds: “A soldier without ambitions to be a general is not a good soldier”. This is an entry-level sales job, but we want someone who is hungry to progress, driven to win and make more money. We are not only offering a job, we would like to build your career as we grow.</p>
