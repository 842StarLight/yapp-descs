<h2>Senior Marketing Manager</h2>

<br><br>
<b>Process:</b> You will manage processes and overall marketing traffic; you and your team will schedule and deploy consumer marketing campaigns across channels (direct mail, email, web, PR and other tactics as needed) to support program goals and you will ensure these plans are communicated to internal and external teams.
