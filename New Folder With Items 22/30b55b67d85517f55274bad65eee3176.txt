<div>The Facebook Marketing Partner Program manages the ecosystem of companies that provides tools and services to maximize the performance of Facebook marketing for its clients. The diverse ecosystem spans 55 countries and ranges from top global agencies to startup tech companies in developing markets, and works as an integral aspect of Facebook's multi-billion-dollar global advertising business.
<br>
<br>
We are looking for a Marketing Product Partnerships Manager to join our team to develop and evolve creative partner programs, which enable businesses to access quality creative at scale. Creative is one of the biggest drivers of sales lift in digital campaigns, but it’s challenging for businesses to develop mobile first creative. Our team has established and grown an ecosystem of creative partners to enable end client success through their solutions and services. This role will focus on developing and managing end to end creative programs that drive discovery and adoption of partners at scale.
<br>
<br>
You will be asked to think through end-to-end program development, testing, launch and optimization, including shaping training, managing program tech builds, and developing partner benefits that are systematically offered to accelerate the success of both the partners and their end clients. In addition, you will lead a cross-functional effort within Facebook that includes working closely with our product, marketing, sales, partner management, measurement, creative and data science teams.
<br>
<br>
You will make an impact on a global scale working with a team that solves big problems for Facebook's partner ecosystem. To be successful in the role, you will be a well-rounded 'business athlete' - an analytical problem solver, who understands the creative and marketing landscape, as well as a dynamic leader in complex cross-functional environments and with partners. This position is located in our Menlo Park headquarters with required travel.</div>
