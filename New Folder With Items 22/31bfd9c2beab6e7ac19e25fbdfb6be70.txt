Sr. Business Manager, Fraud
<br><br>
Fraud – when a customer’s credit card or personal information is stolen – is a defining and increasingly frequent moment in our customers’ financial lives. According to Experian, in 2017 alone 14 million credit card numbers and 158 million social security numbers were exposed. We on the Fraud Digital Products team seek to prevent fraud from happening to our customers, and, if it does, to turn a frustrating and frightening moment into an affirming one. Our current products include Fraud Alerts, Card Lock, Digital Fraud &amp; Disputes Reporting, and the Fraud Orchestration Engine.
<br><br>
As a Senior Manager on our team, you own the strategy for our fraud &amp; disputes reporting products. We are looking to reinvent how we handle these “transaction trouble” moments, with a focus on customization, transparency, and real-time technology. You directly manage product managers to prioritize a roadmap of infrastructure and customer-facing feature enhancements, as well as analysts to monitor our current experiences and generate insights about where our products should go next. You help your associates grow and can rally cross-functional teams of designers, engineers, operations experts, and your peers in the business around a shared goal. You also generate buy-in for your product and vision with senior leaders.
<br><br>
How do you do that? You love consumer software products and can bring an analytical and data-driven mindset to problems of consumer behavior. You enjoy working with a team of diverse peers: knowing you are not the expert in a given area but asking questions anyway, and collaborating to solve complex, high impact problems, even if they aren’t within your assigned scope. You are an expert in crafting written documents that articulate your strategy for audiences of all levels, and accompanying those with compelling and clear verbal presentations.
