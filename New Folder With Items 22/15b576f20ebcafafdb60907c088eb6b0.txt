<br>About You
<br>---------
<br><br>
You are a visionary, but also a realist. You blend technical ability with business acumen. While you are not necessarily a developer, you may have tinkered and are familiar with development methodologies. You understand the connection between financial drivers and end-user metrics. You are effective at connecting long-term vision to near-term objectives.
<br><br>
You are detail-oriented, organized. Nothing slips through the cracks when you're running a project. You measure everything. You are inquisitive, yet you know how to listen and incorporate new knowledge into the product strategy. You know how to work collaboratively across teams in order to produce the strongest outputs. Above all else, you are also an excellent communicator, both written and verbal, and you understand how to effectively convey ideas to various stakeholders across the organization and in the market.
<br><br>
You read the books, you've followed the blogs, and as someone committed to continual improvement, you're excited to improve the overall practice of product management at Passport as much as supporting the product lines themselves.
