<p><b>Are you a sales professional looking for a better opportunity?</b></p>
<p>
Jason Bramblett Real Estate is hiring sales executives at our real estate firm. You’ll get <b>36 months of training (we will take you from a goldfish to a shark) with leads provided for you each month to work for appointments and sales</b>. Commissions range from $2,800 to $4,100 per deal closed.</p>
<p><b>
Your only focus will be selling. All of the administrative and transaction work is handled for you so that you can focus on what you do best—sales.</b></p>
<p>
A <b>base pay is provided to get you going, based on your experience.</b> Top sales executives like yourself can work anywhere, but the best part of this role is the culture and people you’ll work with. This is not a bureaucratic corporate environment, so this role will also include the freedom you desire. Additionally, you'll be in control of your income, since our operations team delivers on the promises you make to customers.</p>
<p><b>
Call (336) 553-0852 or apply now and we’ll call you back within one day.</b> After a brief phone call, during which you can ask more questions about the position, we’ll invite you to meet our team, followed by an orientation meeting with our CEO so that you can learn more about the role upfront. Then, if you like the nature of the work, you’ll begin the interview process with a job offer presented to you at the end if you qualify.</p>

About Company</b><br>
<p>Jason Bramblett Real Estate is a leading residential real estate firm located in Greensboro, NC. We have been very intentional and strategic about investing in infrastructure and both lead generation and marketing systems that empower agents to make the most amount of money in the shortest period of time.</p>
<p>
For example, we have celebrity endorsements from Barbara Corcoran and Glenn Beck with significant radio advertising and a non-duplicatable lead generation system. Simply put, agents get to spend most of their time doing what they love - meeting with buyers and sellers, qualifying leads and selling; versus waiting around wondering where their next client is going to come from. In addition, we also have an inside sales team to qualify leads for you.</p>
