<p><b><i>About Yerdle Recommerce</i></b><br>
</p>
<p>Yerdle is a mission-driven company that has been called a “sharing economy powerhouse” by Fortune magazine for its innovative approach to recommerce. We are at the forefront of creating the circular economy by partnering with the world's leading brands to make it easy for them to buy back and resell their items.</p>
<p>
Traditional commerce models are tailored to handle large quantities of individual SKUs, but our white-label technology and logistics are specially built to receive, evaluate, photograph, post and fulfill one-of-a-kind items for the secondary market. Resale is a revenue and customer engagement opportunity growing at 5 times the rate of e-commerce and 25 times the rate of traditional retail. Not only is it good business, it’s essential for the planet.</p>
<p>
We’ve recently launched resale marketplaces Patagonia Worn Wear, REI Used Gear, Eileen Fisher Renew, Taylor Stitch Restitch, and Arc’teryx Rock Solid with a strong pipeline of brands eager to participate in the circular economy.<br>
