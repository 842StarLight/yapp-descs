<h2>Technical Project Manager (Delivery)</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Unqork is an enterprise software company with a no-code platform that digitizes the entire client lifecycle and eliminates dependence on paper for financial services and insurance companies. The company's patent-pending technology uses AI and machine transcription for risk assessment and digitization, utilizing each client's existing product and underwriting rules, layered on top of legacy IT systems. The software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology creates custom client onboarding and servicing forms using a drag-and-drop interface which can be implemented within weeks instead of months â€“ unlike most hard-coded technology builds. The result is an easy to use and streamlined front-end agent and consumer experience that significantly reduces operational costs and eliminates errors while accelerating sales and business growth.
<br><br>
Some of the world's largest insurance and financial companies use Unqork to define new business rules and deploy products/applications seamlessly and effortlessly without relying on costly development and maintenance of a codebase. Gary Hoberman, former CIO of Metlife, founded Unqork in 2017 with a team of hand-picked industry professionals and has created an 'elegant paradigm shift' in the way insurance and financial companies are able to operate.
<br><br>
