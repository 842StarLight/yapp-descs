<h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>General Summary
</b></h2>
<div><div><div>
<div>The Data Analyst will transform raw, complex data sets into business intelligence tools that will be used by leadership both inside and outside of the organization to analyze key performance indicators and assess the growth and profitability of programs and accounts. This position is a hybrid role that will enable the Analyst to work across several different teams, each having specific needs and uses for data reporting and visualization. The Analyst will have the opportunity to work closely with the core business unit to analyze data and report results directly to senior leadership.</div>
<div>
<br>
Dashboards and KPI reporting will be primarily created using Microsoft Power BI. Power BI allows developers to utilize multiple data formats for source data, including CSV and SQL databases. The main data source for most of the dashboards is a SQL database that provides real-time information from LSI’s proprietary Inventory Management System (IMS). The Analyst will work closely with project teams to assess, define, and implement improved reporting capabilities for unique client requirements as they arise. Over time, the individual will be expected to evolve their role to lead clients from simple, pre-existing business intelligence solutions to forward-looking “what’s next” capabilities using more advanced predictive and prescriptive methods.</div>

<br>
<b>
Internal Reporting</b>- The Analyst will also work to create products that will be used by internal-facing users to visualize key statistics and KPIs for the business.
