<b>Description:</b><br>
The Fort is the new hub for innovation and incubation at Fortive. We have the backing of a large company and the soul of a startup (a Fortune 500 startup, that is), and this is the place where that flame burns brightest.
<br><br>
In The Fort, we combine forces to deploy disruptive technologies and explore new ways of thinking and working. We get out of the office and into the wild to observe first-hand what our customers most need to accelerate progress for the world. We observe, listen, prototype, experiment, analyze, learn, and iterate with passion and speed to fuel Fortive’s growth and build the future. We scout breakthrough ideas and emerging trends from an expansive network stretching from Seattle to Silicon Valley to Shanghai and beyond.
<br><br>
The Fort is built to make growth happen. We start up, we scale up, we shake things up. We face uncertainty head-on and wrestle it to the ground. We fail fast to move our customers forward. We move the needle so much it needs a new gauge. We turn What-if? into What’s next? and How might we? into Wow, we did that! If building a data-driven app in a matter of hours or pushing the frontiers of AI or IoT before lunch sounds like your kind of thing, The Fort just might be your kind of place.
