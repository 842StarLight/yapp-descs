<div>Mendix is on a mission to fundamentally reinvent the way applications are created, by abstracting the process and enabling everyone who has a stake in an enterprise’s digital future — business people and analysts, web developers, software engineers, even CEOs — to meaningfully participate, thereby creating better applications faster. Our goal is simply to create the future of software development.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
IT has long been considered delinquent to the business world – an active impediment to their success. We disagree wholeheartedly. We’ve traveled the world listening to the stories of dozens of Mendix customers and we see leaders, innovators, Davids fighting their Goliath. Heroes to the business, driving impact and unheard-of value, making the impossible possible.
</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>We think it’s time the myth of IT as an obstruction gets dispelled, and we’d like your help doing it. Mendix has launched the Maker Movement, positing that regardless of background or skill, everyone is capable of contributing to software development, and this role will be a key contributor to telling the world of these customer stories.</div>
