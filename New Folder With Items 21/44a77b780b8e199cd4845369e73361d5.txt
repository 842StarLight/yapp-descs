<h2>SMB Account Executive</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>We’re looking for an entrepreneurial, empathetic, and adaptable SMB Account Executive with SaaS experience to join our friendly West Coast team. This role is instrumental in fueling our growth in a segment that has a strong product-market fit. You'll help our future SMB customers to grow their businesses using BuzzBoard’s insights-driven technology.

We need your creativity, drive, and fantastic people skills. At BuzzBoard, you’ll have the resources and time to have meaningful conversations and develop relationships. Your work will make a meaningful and measurable impact for our customers—and importantly, your achievements will be appreciated here. We provide a great service to our clients, and we treat our in-house staff with the same care and attention.<br>
