<b>UWMC Pharmacy</b> has an outstanding opportunity for a <b>FULL-TIME PHARMACY INVENTORY FINANCIAL ANALYST (Day Shifts).</b> The Pharmacy Inventory Financial Analyst will provide financial leadership for pharmacy inventory and expense management for both the University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) and Harborview Medical Center (HMC).

<br>
<br>
<li>Management of all financial processes including the development of tools, reports and analytics to monitor and improve supply chain metrics

<br>
<li>Coordination and communication with health system leadership, finance and auditors related to inventory, expenses and related financial reporting

<br>
<br>
This Pharmacy Inventory Financial Analyst must have expert level understanding of Elite pharmacy supply chain software, a new developed supply chain system in its first use at UWMC and HMC.

This position is responsible for the creation of reports and processes that can be used for routine reporting to leadership. Pharmacy is a large, complex department that maintains a formulary of approximately 5000 drugs supplied by 40 vendors under a variety of contract terms.
