As part of this new digital business venture, you will have the opportunity to work in an entrepreneurial and start-up-like environment to identify, measure, and steer elements of Customer Experience (CX) as it relates to our BrightLabTM SaaS platform, but also in the greater context of interactions with MilliporeSigma. You will be part of a small and growing cross-functional team focused on customer experience, service, success, and support.

Superb working knowledge of planning, facilitating and analyzing customer-based workshops is required in order to focus on co-exploration and co-design (design thinking methods). Along with the ability to help translate results to an agile based product design and development team. In addition to the analysis duties listed above, the Insight Specialist will develop and deploy strategies and tactics to affect behavioral change and enhance customer loyalty and engagement. Other duties will include the ability to help create measurement frameworks while measuring and monitoring CX metrics like Reach and Range, Cycle Time, Product Identification, Churn, Lifetime Value (LTV), Overall Experience Satisfaction and Net Promoter Score (NPS). Being successful in this role will require an affinity for science and technology - being able to convey business value from technical solutions. Be proactive, tenacious, with intellectual curiosity and passion for digital transformation, data analytics, science, with a deep analytical mindset. This position will need to interact with a customer base of Scientists, Lab Managers, Principal Investigators, and Board level executives as well as seamlessly plug into our internal cross-functional team from UX, Product, Technology, and Sales from within the Connected Lab Promise Venture, but also with colleagues from the greater MilliporeSigma organization.
