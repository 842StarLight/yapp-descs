 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>Mavenlink seeks a thoughtful, enthusiastic Rails/React Engineer to join us in our San Francisco R&amp;D team. The role blends front-line development of challenging new features along with big-picture technical influence. You’ll be an influence in making our technology more sophisticated and scalable.</p>
<br>
<p>
Our product is a mature SaaS platform helping service organizations to manage their businesses. Substantial customer growth is bringing interesting engineering challenges that we’d like your help with.</p>
<br>
<p>
In particular, we’re supporting much bigger customers who need to work with larger data sets. As a result, we’ve been solving performance challenges at the forefront of React-based front-end development. Additionally, the API supporting our front end is evolving away from REST and towards the efficiency of GraphQL-inspired approaches, while demands on our back end are prompting creative solutions beyond traditional Rails.</p>
<br>
<p>
Our team culture emphasizes collaboration, communication and enthusiasm for helping each other. We use agile values to evolve our practices. Working in small teams, our engineers write code using pair programming and test-driven development.</p>

Develop challenging customer-facing features using React and Rails</p></li>

<br>
</ul>
<p><b><i>
Your opinion, voice and experience will be valued, and you’ll have our support in pursuing your ideas.</i></b></p>

While this is a senior individual contributor role, there are many opportunities to grow into a leadership role, if desired, through coaching and mentorship.</p>

<li><p>
Commitment to contributing to an inclusive workplace</p></li>
