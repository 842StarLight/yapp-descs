<p>
The Cloud Platform Technology Customer Success Manager (“CSM”) helps existing customers successfully onboard, adopt, and expand their usage of public, private, and hybrid cloud platforms. Customer engagements are managed in an inside sales model, with a combination of outbound and account management tactics. In addition to building strong transactional and strategic customer relationships, a successful CSM manages relationships with technology providers, direct and channel sales partners, and solutions/sales engineers.<br>

<p>N3 empowers our CSM roles to be trusted advisors to customers, working cross-functionally across customer departments (i.e. Marketing, Finance, IT, Back Office, etc.). The best CSMs maximize platform adoption for clients by implementing use cases in multiple departments, broadening the user base while deepening the application stack.</p>
