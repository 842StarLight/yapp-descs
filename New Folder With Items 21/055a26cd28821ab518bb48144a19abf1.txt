<h2>Android Platform Engineer</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Every day, Clover devices handle the core card and point-of-sale processing for hundreds of thousands of merchants. Behind the scenes, we operate a cloud platform providing processing, storage and collaboration for merchants, application developers, service providers and our merchants' customers. Our devices and platform form the backbone of millions of payment interactions between merchants and their customers daily.

To make the job more fun, we add a healthy dose of system architecture, security and payment systems.
