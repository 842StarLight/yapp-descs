<div><div>
<p>The controls project manager (Controls PM) job position falls under the Bastian Controls Team. The Controls PM's normal involvement in a project lifecycle generally begins as part of the Controls Sales team on the project. This may involve estimating, solicitation of subcontractor proposals, scope definition, project timeline scheduling, assistance in presentations, review of proposed contracts and terms, and systems design. As the sales process continues, the Controls PM takes on increasing responsibility for understanding and controlling Bastian's risk from technical, contractual, cash flow, and organizational standpoint. Once the order becomes a contract, the PM has sole responsibility for budget, schedule, closure of project and customer management. The PM translates the sales estimate into a budget suitable for entering in Microsoft AX. The PM coordinates the effort of our Controls team, our suppliers and selected subcontractors with the customer for a successful project. The Controls PM will be familiar with all phases of a controls project including: concept and research, sales support, estimating, component selection, network design, panel design, ACAD layout, purchasing, device troubleshooting, PLC/VLC programming and HMI tagging.</p>
