<h2>Full-Cycle Sales Representative</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>*<br>Twenty Over Ten is one of the fastest growing SaaS companies at the intersection of Marketing and Finance, growth that stems from capitalizing on two megatrends just coming to Financial Services today: personalized content and marketing automation.</p>
<p>Twenty Over Ten’s latest product, Lead Pilot, brings these two trends together by pairing smart content automation and pre-written campaigns with personalized landing pages and lead generation techniques aided by AI. Up until now, strict compliance limitations in the financial services industry made it near impossible to create, manage and run full digital marketing campaigns without hiring an entire team of people to manage the work. This revolutionary marketing platform is finally changing this.</p>
<p>Fueled by a growing number of large customers in financial services, our already-established successful website product and compliance engine, and the launch of Lead Pilot, Twenty Over Ten is expanding quickly and we are looking to hire multiple Sales Representatives to join our team as we enter this next phase of growth. This is an exciting opportunity to join a rapidly growing SaaS company at a pivotal time.</p>
