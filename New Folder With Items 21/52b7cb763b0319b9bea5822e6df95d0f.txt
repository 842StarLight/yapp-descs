<p>
Whether you're on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product's journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you'll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>
<p>
Grow and foster marketing partnerships with emerging OEM partners beyond the mobile category. These evolving partnerships require a manager with a high-level of problem solving and strategic thinking skills to prioritize both new OEM opportunities, e.g., Auto, and partners within that category. Build long-term partner relationships and collaborate with the OEM partner marketing team and internal stakeholders to develop new initiatives, define measurable results, craft compelling partner-facing presentations, create new OEM category playbooks, and oversee marketing budgets and project timelines for co-marketing partnerships with emerging OEM partners.</p>

Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems-from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can-changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>
