<p>Emergent Software is seeking a Sales professional to join our thriving team. Our organization has grown significantly based upon our track record of successful software delivery. It is time to further expand into a market that is hungry for true technology partners who value their clients. This is a sales role you can feel confident in with positive references that back up the quality of work promised.</p>
<p>
You will be focused on hunting new opportunities and farming warm leads coming in through various channels. Ideal clients are small-to-mid-sized businesses who are seeking quality service, delivery, design, deployment and on-going support.

The development team’s engagement continues well beyond the initial project through on-going maintenance commitments, which keeps your client engaged.</p>
