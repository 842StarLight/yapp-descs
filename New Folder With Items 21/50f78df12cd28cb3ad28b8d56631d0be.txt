<p>Cigna strongly embraces the scientific evidence that the use of tobacco products is harmful to the health of the user, the user’s family, and the general public. With that in mind, Cigna will no longer hire – where state law permits - applicants who use tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars and chewing or smokeless tobacco. Currently, these states are: AL, AK, AZ, AR, DE, FL, GA, HI, IA, ID, KS, MD, MA, MI, NE, OH, PA, TX, UT, VT and WA. As part of the pre-employment drug screen in these states, you’ll be screened for nicotine. If you test positive for nicotine, although we won’t be able to offer you employment, we encourage you to check with your medical provider to explore your options and resources for quitting. Once you’re tobacco-free, you may re-apply for jobs with Cigna in six months.
