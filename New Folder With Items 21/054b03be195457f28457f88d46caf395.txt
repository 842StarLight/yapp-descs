Overview</b>
</div>
<div>
<p>Want to manage a high-profile in-market research program that significantly drives IGT results? This project management role has responsibility for planning and executing IGT’s core video and premium test bank programs, which are complex in nature and delivers tangible results: your efforts come to fruition on casino floors and drive in-field testing where metrics determine which titles are released to market and which are held back.<br>
</p>
<p>This role is first in the business to touch and feel brand new core titles, and interacts regularly with customers, Account Managers, Field Service Technicians, Product Managers and many cross-discipline peers. Your efforts help elevate high-potential titles while also allowing IGT to take risks with innovative titles without market exposure—those are games that don’t pass test bank. Overall the test bank program and this role is high visibility, requires a lot of customer interaction, and is key for IGT meeting its targets. We are open to hiring this individual in Reno or Las Vegas.</p>
