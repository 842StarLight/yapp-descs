Advisors bring Gartner's research, best practices, and tools to life across a broad range of world leading clients. It's the job of a Senior Principal Advisor to increase client engagement and ensure each client is fully leveraging Gartner's resources. They do that by asking insightful questions to diagnose the root causes of client challenges and advise on the best course of action. They might also suggest a different course of action they hadn't considered or talk them through a best practice from a different industry that could work within their business.
