TIGERA OVERVIEW<br>
<br>
Enterprise adoption of Kubernetes is increasing. According to Datadog, over 80% of organizations are using container orchestration tool if they are in production and Kubernetes is the leading choice for these enterprises. One of the biggest barriers to adoption is that traditional security solutions do not work in this environment. This is the problem that Tigera solves.<br>
<br>
We have created the world's best zero trust security and continuous compliance solution for Kubernetes platforms. We have some of the smartest engineers on the planet who are building an incredible solution for a really complex problem. Some of the largest enterprises have embraced our technology as they are building out their container platforms. We power a majority of the Kubernetes clusters around the planet with our Network Security solution.<br>
<br>
To help these customers succeed, we are building a world-class Customer Success team and are looking for technical rock stars with a passion for designing and deploying technical solutions based on cutting-edge technology.
