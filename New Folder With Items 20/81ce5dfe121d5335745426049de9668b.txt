<h2>Product Manager</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">About Brideside
<br><br>
Brideside is reinventing wedding retail by providing a seamless and complimentary styling service for modern brides and their parties. We are powered by a team of style consultants who provide a concierge service to each bridal party - whether they shop online, in one of our showrooms, or with our Try at Home program.
<br><br>
At our core is our belief that bridal party styling should be completely stress-free and incredibly fun. We are dedicated to celebrating and supporting women and the female friendships that are at the heart of every bridal party.
<br><br>
We have experienced rapid growth in the past few years and are looking for a curious Product Manager with deep user empathy, a passion for solving problems with technology, and a desire to learn, grow and adapt in a fast-paced start up environment.

An ideal candidate is a self-starter who loves learning and appreciates an 'all hands-on deck' mentality, a collaborative environment, and is comfortable with ambiguity and change.
