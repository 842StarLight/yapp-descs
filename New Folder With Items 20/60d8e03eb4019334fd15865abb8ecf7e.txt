<h2>Marketing Operations Manager</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Who we are looking for?
<br><br>
Are you someone who can tell a good story with data?
<br><br>
If that sounds like you, we need you to help tell ours at Fieldwire.
<br><br>
We're looking for someone to be the "source of truth" on all things related to our marketing reporting. But it doesn't stop there.

<br><br>
This role will have high visibility to Fieldwire's leadership team. That's because you'll be in charge of implementing and owning our revenue attribution model, which will play a vital role in determining which marketing channels to invest in as we scale our growth.
<br><br>
You'll also need to be comfortable working on a rocket ship. We plan to grow fast, and to keep up with that growth, and you'll have to be flexible and have a strong desire to take on additional responsibilities.

What you'll be doing?

As our company grows, we'll need our marketing operations team member to be proactive and always think not only months, but years into the future.
