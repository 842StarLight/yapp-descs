Our Telecommunications, Media and Technology (TMT) industry clients include some of the most valued companies in the U.S. and many of the world’s top global brands. We are poised to help clients shape their evolving business models, scale and transform their operations, modernize their processes and technologies, and constantly improve their customer experience. Our <b>Technology</b> sector includes the world leaders in software, semiconductor, Cloud, analytics, cyber, networking, enterprise and personal computing, and technology services.</div>

<div></div>
<p>Companies in the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) industry are undergoing profound shifts in how they sell and deliver their products and services. Increasingly, customers are demanding that they be able to consume offerings—from media content to technology infrastructure and enterprise software solutions—in a flexible, scalable, and secure manner. Customers want to be able to choose where, how, and how much they consume and pay for.</p>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<p>Flexible consumption requires an entirely new business model that fundamentally alters how products and services are sold and to whom. Moving to a pay-per-use business model may call for changes to business capabilities, operating models, and enabling technology platforms. In order to make the transition from a more traditional model, executives first need to determine what this “new” business model should look like. It all starts with understanding where you are currently—and then determining where you need to be in order to respond best to customer requirements and market shifts.</p>
