<p></p>
<p>As SEO Strategist/Analyst, you’ll be responsible for all aspects of search engine marketing (SEO) including technical site audits, competitive research, link building, reporting, analyzing data, spotting trends, and many other facets of site optimization for our brands – Disc Makers, BookBaby, and Merchly. We generate hundreds of thousands of site visits each month, and you will be largely responsible for keyword and content development, creative execution, organic keyword targeting, and ROI analysis.
