<div><div><ul>The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is the nation’s largest for-hire transportation agency, licensing and regulating the City’s yellow and green taxicabs, for-hire vehicles (including apps like Uber, Lyft, Via, and Juno), commuter vans, and luxury limousines. TLC develops and enforces rules to promote safety, transparency, as well as consumer and driver protection for a vital mode of transport in New York City. The vehicles, businesses, and drivers licensed and regulated by the agency move over one million people a day. With the introduction of new apps and technologies, TLC is on the front lines of a changing mobility landscape. To learn more about the TLC, please visit: www.nyc.gov/taxi.<br>
In May 2019, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a 45-day review of practices by brokers in the taxi industry. TLC-licensed brokers represent clients in the purchase or sale of a taxicab medallion. The review evaluated whether brokers violated existing TLC rules and recommended policy changes to identify and avoid potential broker conflicts and clarify brokers’ duty to act in the best interest of their clients. TLC is expanding its capacity to conduct ongoing reviews of this nature by creating a new Business Practices Accountability Unit (BPAU). The unit’s mission is to protect TLC drivers and medallion owners from unfair or misleading industry practices by TLC-licensed businesses. Working in the Division of Finance and Administration, the BPAU Analysts will promote greater accountability and transparency of business practices in the for-hire transportation sector. The Analysts will collaborate with agency partners to promote sound business practices, and investigate violations of TLC rules and relevant local, state or federal regulations. Building upon the 45-day review of broker practices, the analysts will evaluate other TLC-licensed businesses and undertake a comprehensive review of existing TLC rules governing TLC-licensed business conduct to identify areas where new regulations are needed to protect drivers and medallion owners. The analysts will work with other divisions within TLC, including licensing, prosecution and external affairs, on any necessary revisions to the licensure and renewal process, assisting in investigation of rule violations by TLC-licensed businesses, and educating drivers of their rights when working with a TLC-licensed business.<br>
