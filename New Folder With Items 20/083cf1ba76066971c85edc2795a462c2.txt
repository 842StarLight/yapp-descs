SAs help our customers build highly scalable, flexible, resilient, secure and cost-effective cloud architectures. As a trusted customer advocate, the SA helps organizations adopt advanced cloud-based solutions and migrate existing on premises workloads to the cloud. In this role, SAs will have the opportunity to help shape and execute a strategy to build mindshare and a broad use of AWS technologies for large, strategic customers.<br>
