<p><b>A bit about us…</b></p>
<p>30 years ago, our Founder Bill Squiric created Ad Pages to solve a need in the market. He saw the opportunity to help small businesses expand their reach to local audiences at a very fair price. Big box retailers and franchise juggernauts were squeezing out the mom and pop businesses, and making it very difficult for the American dream of business start-up to survive. By creating an affordable “shared” mail piece filled with valuable offers from local businesses, distributed directly to demographically-targeted homeowners within a small radius of business owners shops, the idea of “Ad Pages” was born. From that single 20,000 copy publication in Plano, TX, an entire industry was formed.</p>
<p><b>Times have changed - the core business problem we solve has not….</b></p>
<p>Ad Pages continues to serve this underserved market of small to medium sized business owners that make up the heart of your local community. Many “copy-cat” publications have come and gone, but Ad Pages remains a staple in the shared direct mail business because we have stayed true to our roots - helping businesses grow. Now, more than 26 million copies of Ad Pages are distributed annually to households in nearly 100 cities across TX and MO. In addition to print advertising solutions, we have digital offerings that continue to evolve and innovate. In short, we help small businesses compete with the big-boys.</p>
<p>Our current team of 50 Sales Executives are responsible for helping 1000’s of advertisers grow their businesses on a monthly basis. Our outstanding support and production staff continue to build on the values instilled by our founder - quality, service, integrity, profitability, and leadership. (By the way...our original Founder is still the current Owner &amp; President - how’s that for stability!) We have always been, and remain debt-free. We are an agile, yet powerful provider of advertising services that continues to innovate, yet we stay focused - providing results for our customers.</p>
<p><b>This is where you come in...</b></p>
<p>Reporting directly to the Houston Sales Manager, you’ll join a sales team that shares the companies’ same core competencies.</p>
<p><b>Your character has a number of components: Do these sound familiar?</b></p>
<ul><li><b>Self-Starter: </b></li></ul>
<p>This is a hunter position, with very little outside lead support. You must be comfortable with cold-calling and minimal supervision. You need to have a “<i>If it is to be, than it is up to me</i>” attitude. You should be able to cold call 20+ new businesses per day, set appointments with owners and decision makers, create a clear follow up program with potential advertisers, and organize and track sales activity. We provide the tools...you provide the effort. This is an opportunity for someone who is self-disciplined, hungry, social, organized, and has a basic understanding of how advertising can help local businesses grow…..we can teach you the rest. When can you start?</p>
<ul><li><b>Track Record of Success: </b></li></ul>
<p>A background in advertising sales is NOT a prerequisite for this role...a track record of success IS. Do you excel in your current role? Do you want to continue to be a top performer - a Rockstar? Let’s chat!</p>
<ul><li><b>Unwavering Work Ethic: </b></li></ul>
<p>Sales is hard. Period. If it were easy...there would be no accountants (no offense to the bean counters… we still need you) Let’s face it….you are going to get rejected and knocked down...repeatedly. What separates you from the pack, is that you get back up...time and time again. It is that “can’t lose” attitude that has gotten you this far. Let’s apply your hard work and passion to our products, and make some serious money together!</p>
<ul><li><b>Willingness to Learn: </b></li></ul>
<p>Nobody was born an “Advertising Expert”...and nobody at our company knows everything about advertising sales. But one thing all of our employees have in common is their willingness to continue learning. We expect the same from you...but we did not have to tell you that...after-all….you made it this far in this posting!</p>
<ul><li><b>Love a Challenge: </b></li></ul>
<p>The challenges are great (as are the rewards). Small businesses have limited funds, yet they’re approached by a plethora of marketing opportunities. So, we must distinguish ourselves – by both our results &amp; our character. Our message needs to be tight, differentiated, and impactful. That’s what makes you so important. Ready for the challenge?</p>
<ul><li><b>Unbridled Earning Potential: </b></li></ul>
<p>You are a Rockstar...your compensation should reflect that. You don’t place a limit on your earning potential...so why should we? Our top performers take full advantage of our generous commission structure...but it is not given...it is earned. Do you have what it takes to be a Rockstar for our company?</p>
<p><b><i>If you share these traits, let’s have a conversation. (Confidential, of course)</i></b></p>
<p>Job Type: Full-time</p>
<p>Experience:</p>
<ul><li>B2B sales: 2 years (Preferred)</li></ul>
