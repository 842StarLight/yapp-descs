<div><b>Experience</b></div>
<br>
<div>Skills Needed: It is necessary to locate and inspect every property in the county at some point which requires the appraiser to have the ability to read legal descriptions and then safely navigate to that location. There is an extensive amount of dialogue between the appraiser and the general public so good verbal and written communication skills are necessary. The job is governed by the laws of the state of Oklahoma so knowledge of Ad Valorem tax law for state and county government is essential as well. There is a substantial amount of mathematical and analytical processing that must be done so critical thinking skills are some of the most important skills necessary to perform the job well. Most of the analysis and data collection/transformation occurs on a computer which requires extensive knowledge of Microsoft Word, Excel, Access and various other types of sketching, and mapping software.
