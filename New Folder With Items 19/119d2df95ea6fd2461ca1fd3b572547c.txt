Essential Functions
<br>â—You are a skilled, self-motivated marketing manager with 8 or more years of experience developing results-driven media plans for targeted audiences, preferably including new product launches. Youâ€™re broadly-skilled across marketing channels such as email, digital advertising, social media, direct mail, on-site promotion, etc. with the ability to distribute marketing content via strategic consumer journeys with strong calls-to-action at each touchpoint.
<br><b>â—You have been in the trenches:</b> you know how to get things done. You can work strategically but can also roll up your sleeves and drive new opportunities across the line with detail and rigor garnering the support of InfoArmor leadership and support teams.
<br><b>â—You are data-driven:</b> your beliefs are strong â€” you can come to the table with a clear point of viewâ€” but loosely held â€” what you think shifts in light of new data. You are able to compare various forms of data with a qualitative market perspective (lots of informative conversations within your account) and strong business instincts to frame a new opportunity, prioritize it and make the case itâ€™s the next big bet. You analyze the performance of your campaigns and promotional events toward business goals and continuously optimize as needed.
<br><b>â—You are a â€˜bringing clarity out of chaosâ€™ thinker:</b> you can help clear the fog, synthesize dozens of bits of insight and weave together a coherent, winning proposal that captures the needs of the client and their customers, and best utilizes the strengths of InfoArmor and Allstate. You have excellent project management skills to streamline complex workstreams involving both internal partners and external resources
<br><b>â—You have a growth mindset:</b> you are mature, curious, resilient, and can take the long view. You know, from experience, how tough it is to get something across the line, and then to manage it through its full lifecycle in order to extract its greatest value.
<br><b>â—You are a team player:</b> you enjoy working cross-functionally in order to leverage your teammateâ€™s strengths and experience; you know how to get the most out of your team. You collaborate with various cross-functional partners such as finance, product &amp; growth marketing, design, content, etc. to ensure all of your partner channel activations are strategically aligned with business goals and that marketing creative is cohesive across channels.
<br><b>â—The fine print:</b> you have a related degree (business, marketing, etc.). Ideal candidates have experience in one or more of the following: digital media management, marketing management, retail channel development, digital distribution, or affinity marketing. General familiarity with marketing analytics tools, design programs and marketing automation software is helpful.
