<p><b>Day in The Life of the ERP Systems Analyst</b></p>
<p>Its Tuesday, you’re excited because you have a testing plan kick-off today and you’re ready for it. As a task master, procrastination is not in your vocabulary, so your testing plan is detailed out with clear deadlines, tasks, assignees in Asana. Morning routine is important to you and today includes a quick meditation, a walk with the dog and gratitude journaling. A healthy breakfast and coffee caps off the morning and you head to work energized and ready to be a “joy warrior!”</p>
<p>You greet those who are already in the office and scan your emails, Asana, slack. Via exception reporting, you see a 856 EDI file was rejected by a trading partner. You immediately dive in and start troubleshooting, determining root cause analysis &amp; next steps to address. Via a slack message you see that the team is having trouble accessing the ERP system so you submit a ticket ASAP. You keep an eye on the ticket and keep the team updated. You review your asana tasks and prepare your 3 top priorities for the team huddle at 10:38 am. Next you look at your sprint for the week and make sure nothing is at risk.You make some updates on a few tasks and plan some “heads down” time to work on testing a new q-patch. A new team member is starting next week, so you schedule some time to walk them through our systems as related to their role and submit a ticket to set them up with an ERP system login.</p>
<p>By nature, you’re a strategic thinker and a process driver. You enjoy the satisfaction that comes via strategically improving processes and learning, sharing &amp; implementing new ways of doing things, whether it is discovering a new feature/functionality in our current ERP system or researching new technology/integrations that will help us scale. Work smarter, not harder is your M.O. and your natural curiosity drives you to always explore and improve.</p>
<p>Following the big meeting, you update the testing plan and make sure deliverables and dates are clear and manageable. You head home with a smile on your face because it is easy to see how your efforts supported the team and, via strategic planning, you have managed expectations and set yourself up for success to accomplish goals.</p>
