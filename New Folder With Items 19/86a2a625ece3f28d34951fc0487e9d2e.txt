<p>What We’re Looking For:<br>
</p>
<p>We believe that finding the right team member is a lot like dating, which means we’re less concerned about what your resume looks like, and more interested in how our conversation goes. While qualifications matter (see below), here are some of the things about your personality that we care about:</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>You are responsible and have integrity. This isn’t typically a resume line-item, but it’s very important and we will want to speak to your former colleagues.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>You are confident. Since you’re an early employee you will need to be a leader, by definition. We want you to believe and aspire to shaping what our company does.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>You don’t mind doing everything. And anything. Building a startup looks glamorous. Until it doesn’t. We need someone who doesn’t think twice about rolling up her/his sleeves and getting messy.</p>
<br>
<p></p>

<li>Exceed a quarterly and annual quota</li>
<li>Collect feedback and use it to help influence product development</li>

<p></p>
