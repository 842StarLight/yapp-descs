Who we are looking for
<br><br>
You are self-driven, you are a strong champion of design thinking, you are pragmatic in brokering feature changes due to development/time constraints. Still, you are all about process and are methodological in your approach to solutions.
<br><br>
We also need someone who is passionate about efficiency in design. Our primary job is to make our UI invisible and frictionless where we can. Where we cannot, you know how to shape the users’ perception to minimize the impact. You live, breathe, and eat the adage “less is more”.
<br><br>
Probably most important, you are a life-long learner who loves to challenge themselves with new ideas and new skills outside of work while keeping up to date on design trends, technologies, as well as having an eye on what the future is bringing.
<br><br>
<b>Responsibilities and Duties:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Can work with PMs to translate requirements into engaging and efficient UIs and experiences</li>
<li>Create design deliverables, from hand drawn sketches to wireframes to hi-fidelity mockups to storyboards and process flows</li>
<li>Prioritize features and design challenges by understanding their significance and impact across the product as a whole</li>
<li>Create and optimize vector and bitmap images for inclusion in our app or for the App Store or marketing materials</li>
<li>Work with the engineers to make sure what is pushed to users matches the designs</li>
<li>Understand the value of design patterns and look to work within those parameters but can prudently recommend updates or changes to patterns when practical</li>
<li>Collaborate with other designers, PMs, customer success teams, developers, and business stakeholders, both in person and remotely</li>
<li>You don’t design “for” Accessibility &amp; Universal Design because that’s just a given</li>

<ul>
<li>3-5 years of experience with mobile design</li>
<li>Experience designing for enterprise platforms</li>
<li>You’re familiar with CRM applications and their users</li>
<li>We use Sketch and Zeplin, other tools are welcome but these two are how you will collaborate. You don’t have to know them coming in but you need to be willing and able to learn.</li>
<li>Up-to-date with the latest UI trends, techniques, interaction design trends, usability principles, and platform guidelines</li>
<li>Ability to juggle between multiple projects</li>
<li>Experience in existing mobile paradigms such as Material Design and Human Interface Guidelines</li>
