<h2>PRINT ADVERTISING SALES PROFESSIONAL</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>We’re looking for a good old-fashioned print adman or adwoman to help us sell ads in our direct mail coupon publications. Your territory is from Irvine south to San Clemente. RETIREES WELCOME!!! If you have experience in selling for newspapers, The (now defunct) PennySaver, other direct mail coupon publications, or even tv or radio….we want to meet you. This can be a full-time, part-time, or very-part-time job; that’s up to you. We will pay 50% commission for the first month, 40% for the second month, 30% for the third month, and 25% after that. Monthly bonus incentives are offered as well. You will earn residual commissions for as long as you and/or the advertiser are with the company. If you like, you will also have the opportunity to cross-sell many of our digital services, but that is not a requirement. We are looking for print people, and we need them now! You will receive great paper and product training, but you must be able to go out on your own sales calls from the beginning and hit the ground running. Once you get going, we will give you some call-ins and maybe some house accounts. That all depends upon your close ratio on your new business. We have a small satellite office in Dana Point, which is available to stop in and make calls and put your feet up for a while, but you will be most successful if you have a home-office as well. If this sounds like just the job for you, please send a resume that includes your advertising sales background and a cover letter why you would like this job. We look forward to meeting our next Print Advertising Sale Rep.</p>
