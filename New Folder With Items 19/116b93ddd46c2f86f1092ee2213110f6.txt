<br>We call ourselves Blumers. We work on really exciting stuff together, we eat and play together, and we help each other out (who woulda thought?!).

We're a resourceful and scrappy bunch, currently at around 200 employees in 4 offices in the Bay Area, Boston, Chicago, and Hong Kong. And we have a well-established and growing customer and partnership base across the supply chain industry.

<li>Fun – free lunch Fridays, happy hours, office surprises and more</li>
<li>Humility – everyone leaves their egos at home</li>
<li>Innovation – We're working on some really cool stuff for the supply chain, whether it's AI, machine learning, IoT or blockchain.</li>
