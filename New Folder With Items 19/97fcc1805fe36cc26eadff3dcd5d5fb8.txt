<p><b>Extent of Supervision (level of direction provided and limits in acting independently):</b></p>
<p>A person in this position operates under immediate to limited supervision, receives general instruction, follows routine procedures independently, and is responsible for managing and carrying out areas of responsibility within the scope of established goals and objectives. Specific directives may be provided for execution. Variations from procedure or problems are reported to the immediate supervisor without delay.</p>
<p><b>Physical Requirements / Working Conditions:</b></p>
<p>The physical demands described herein are representative of those that must be met by an employee to perform the essential functions of this job. Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions (team members are required to contact the designated Human Resources in such cases to document the accommodation).</p>
<p>Significant physical strength, physical resilience, and mental alertness is imperative within this job. This is primarily a non-stationary position working in a non-temperature-controlled environment with extended periods of time spent in diverse positions due to diverse nature of customer facilities. Extended periods of sitting or standing at a desk/counter occur to prepare reports and to drive. Significant mental alertness and quick reflexes are required in order to safely drive. Standing and walking is required to interface with customers, gain access to their buildings, which may require the use of stairs, and to deliver communications or product to customers as well as within the facility, requiring the ability to, lift, carry, climb, reach, stoop, kneel, crouch, and continuous mental and visual attention with eyesight correctable to 20/20 and specific vision requirements of close vision and the ability to adjust focus. Peripheral vision and depth perception are also required for driving safety, and to safely work in diverse customer sites including the possibility of warehouse, production, construction, and other hazardous locations. The employee operates a keyboard/mouse, answers telephone calls and occasionally bends, reaches, and pushes and pulls file drawers to file documents requiring finger and hand dexterity, reaching, lifting, and twisting. While the use of tools is encouraged, employees in this job carry product weighing up to 70 lbs. across diverse customer conditions and perform product installations that may not allow for material handling equipment and may require extended-reach lifting. Participation in group lifts for heavier weight or awkward positions (including extended reach) is required. Employees push pallets (using a pallet jack) with product weighing over 1 ton. Employees load, off-load, push, and pull wheeled carts with product loads commonly weighing over 200 pounds. Stacking of batteries occurs with all branch personnel, not otherwise restricted, from time to time, requiring physical endurance to move individual units in quantities exceeding 3 tons in a day. Maintaining strength and resilience to do so is required. Ability to recover quickly and repeat tasks is necessary. Team members are required to notify their manager if they believe that they are not able to safely continue to lift and require a recovery period of lighter duties. Personal protective equipment consists of uniform, safety glasses, gloves, and safety-toe shoes (may include ice cleats), and may additionally require apron, face shield, safety goggles, ear protection, and/or rubber gloves in interface with the charging area, installations, and clean-up process.</p>
