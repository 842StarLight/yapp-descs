We like to think that we are helping make the internet safer.

The <b>Vice President of Customer Success</b> will be the chief customer leader for driving exceptional post-sale customer success and experience for every Auth0 customer, and is ultimately accountable for ensuring all Auth0 customers rapidly deploy, adopt and expand their use of Auth0.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
You will be responsible for 100+ employees in all post-sales functions, including Technical Account Management (TAM), Support, Professional Services, as well as quasi-evangelist roles like our Customer Success Architects. You will be part of the Go-To-Market leadership team and report to the Chief Revenue Officer.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>
What You Will Do</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>
This senior executive will iterate upon and evolve our already successful post-sales functions to support the explosive growth Auth0 has seen, and will continue to experience for the foreseeable future.</li>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<li>
Technical Account Management: Our TAM team must increase the value of guidance and prescription it provides as it onboards and supports new customers from signature date to application go-live. This will require revision and expansion of that team’s playbook with variations by customer segment, as well as creation of a programmatic ‘tech touch’ content machine to support smaller customers at scale. Implementation and tracking of a standardized CSAT measurement (beyond just churn and expansion metrics) and the championing of that measurement across the business will also be important.</li>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<li>
Enablement and Professional Services: Our PS organization provides enablement, pair programming and design review services to less than 10% of our customers. While not interested in building a pyramidal, traditional PS package, we do believe this team can increase its reach within our customer base to drive faster and more successful adoption and license utilization at scale. You will work with team members to augment and implement this strategy.</li>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<li>
Support: The Auth0 Support organization provides 24/7 coverage for our global enterprise customer base. You will work with the Support team to help grow the degree to which it can deflect tickets to centralized Q&amp;A resources, the Auth0 Community, as well as devise and implement other strategies to help the org scale with the demands of the business.</li>
</ul>
