<h2>Store Manager - Dallas</h2>

<p><b>Welcome to Chubbies. Here is what we believe.</b></p>
<p>We believe in the weekend
<br>
We believe that "short shorts" is a redundancy
<br>
We believe in swim trunks, swim shorts, bathing suits, swim suits or whatever the heck else you wanna call 'em because we believe that if you've got a pair of those on, well, you must be doing something right
<br>
We believe in the right your quads have to a life of freedom and sunshine
<br>
We believe in aloha shirts (aka Hawaiian shirts)
<br>
We believe in comfort
<br>
We DO NOT believe in the top button - well, we believe it EXISTS, but we don't believe in the principle for which it stands
<br>
We believe in our fathers - they led the way; we are but revolutionaries standing on the shoulders of amazingly mustachio'd giants in proper length shorts
<br>
We believe in things with American flags on them, whether that's shorts, swim trunks,or the feathers of a bald eagle being ridden by George Washington
<br>
We believe sweat shorts are the greatest innovation in lounging since hammock cup holders were invented in the early 1780s
<br>
And we damn sure believe in Friday at Five</p>
<div>Onward to the Weekend &gt;

This position will be an asset in the build-out and set up of the store. This position will also be vital to the success of an aggressive set of sales goals. Chubbies is a lifestyle brand that prides itself on delivering the ultimate Weekend shopping experience unlike any other out there. As the Store Manager, you will be at the front line leading this effort.</p>
<p>The success of this role hinges on complete ownership of inventory, training, merchandising, and delegation all while being the leading example of the Chubbies culture. This is a business savvy role with an emphasis on people management, we would ideally like to hire an excited and experienced new team member who will be able to hit the ground running with 1-2 weeks of initial training.</p>
<p><b> You Might Be Our Chubster If:</b></p>
<p>You're instinctively drawn to environments that require bold entrepreneurship. You believe in the power of exceptional customer experience, organization, diligence, resourcefulness, diversity, inclusion, and fun, and their positive impact on the bottom line. You understand the importance of feeling fulfilled at work, and have the intelligence to back up how training, development, strategy. You have experience in all areas of retail management, motivation, and hitting projected goals, as well as other areas that aren't even on our radar—yet.</p>
<p><b>The Nuts &amp; Bolts:</b></p>
<p>You'll be our boots on the ground, dedicated exclusively to the success of your geo, so you will need a good number of years of merchandising, inventory management, recruitment and people management. We will equip you with the tools need to get the job done, but expect you to bring your 'A' game and an entrepreneurial spirit to the Store Manager position to exceed expectations.</p>
<p>While day-to-day management will be a part of your job, we are looking for a true business partner who's retail whiz, and has developed and managed their own teams.</p>
<p><b>Experience: </b>We like to deliver the ultimate Weekend experience 7 days a week, 365 days a year. We want to make sure every person who enters our doors is blown away with how radical our shop is, how friendly our guys and gals are, and how downright revolutionary our products are.</p>
<p><b>Inventory:</b> You will be responsible for ensuring all product is checked in, tagged, and merchandised on to the floor according to the launch flow.</p>
<p><b>Merchandising: </b>We want our visual story to be exciting, compelling, and downright radical. We provide guidance, but expect you to fulfill and uphold visual standards.</p>
<p><b>Appearance:</b> In coordination with inventory, merchandising, comes overall appearance. We should be able to eat off the floors and see twinkling stars around every section of product.</p>
<p><b>Recruitment:</b> You'll own your locations recruitment process, identifying gaps in schedules and skillsets and the best routes to finding a diverse group of exceptionally hard working employees that not only work their tails off, but are ultimate brand ambassadors to engage with Chubster Nation.</p>
<p><b>Team Development:</b> At Chubbies, we have a wide variety of teams and run mean and lean. You' will have access to endless resources, but ultimately tasked with the continuing education and development of your specific team (i.e. bi-weekly all-hands meetings, sales role playing exercises, new product launches, product knowledge, etc). Our ideal candidate has experience building and managing their own teams, and can empathize with the opportunities and challenges of assembling a strong, healthy team.</p>
<p><b>Goals &amp; Targets: </b>The sum of your management efforts should result in crushing each and every goal set in front of you. Goals and targets are extremely obtainable when all of our other boxes are checked and we are all consistent and aligned.</p>
<p><b>Culture:</b> We live and breathe <i>The Weekend</i> flirt a fine line between work and play. We like to say we play hard, but work harder and we need you to be able to do the same. You will organize in-store 'Friday at Five' events, and surprise us with ideas we hadn't thought of. You will also ensure that each employee is delivering the same friendly interaction and experience with every single person who comes through our doors. Our customers are our friends and that needs to be the expectation.</p>
<p><b>Resources:</b> You'll work closely with our other Retail Managers, and the Team at HQ who will offer a helping hand as you grow and hit goals.</p>
<p><b>If you were working for us, here are some of the things you might have done last week:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Organized and lead a team meeting with 5+ Chubbies sales associates, clearly laying out sales goals, delegating weekly responsibilities, and product focus.</li>
<li>Brainstormed and drafted a plan of action to discuss with HQ to drive Foot Traffic, Average Order Value, and Conversion Rate in your location. (Those metrics determine your success or failure.)</li>
<li>Worked with Chubbies HQ to merchandise and update the store, window displays, product messaging, etc. to make the store the absolute best it can be.</li>
