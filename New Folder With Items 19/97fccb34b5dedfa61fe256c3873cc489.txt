A Tax Auditor is the entrance level of the professional tax auditing class series and is primarily responsible for auditing Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT), also known as sales tax. The employee performs responsible, professional work in the auditing of financial records of businesses to calculate sales/TPT and Use Tax liability; determining compliance with established policies, procedures, codes and ordinances/laws and generating tax revenues for the City and other Arizona taxing jurisdictions. This class performs related duties as required.</p>

This class is distinguished from the Senior Tax Auditor class in that the latter handles advanced level audits requiring well-developed professional knowledge of accounting theory, and investigative and reconstructive accounting skills that are utilized when records are incomplete, poorly kept, or extremely complex. This class is supervised by the Tax Audit Supervisor through work papers, reports, and conferences. Employees in this class may progress by noncompetitive promotion to a Senior Tax Auditor after successfully completing original City probation, being employed a minimum of one year as a City of Mesa Tax Auditor, meeting the specific criteria-based promotion requirements, and meeting the minimum qualifications of the Senior Tax Auditor classification. This class is FLSA exempt-administrative.</p>

Senior Tax Auditor ($53,520.34 - $76,502.40 annually)</b><br>
<br>
The Senior Tax Auditor is primarily responsible for performing professional Transactional Privilege Tax (TPT) auditing work, known as sales tax, involving on-site field audits of businesses located both in and out of the City that are liable for sales/TPT and Use Tax under the City of Mesa and State of Arizona codes/regulations/ordinances/statutes/laws. Duties include: auditing financial records of taxable businesses to calculate sales/TPT and Use Tax liability; determining compliance with established policies, procedures, and tax laws; generating tax revenues for the City of Mesa and other Arizona taxing jurisdictions. This class performs related duties as required.<br>
<br>
The Senior Tax Auditor is distinguished from the Tax Auditor by the responsibility for performing journey-level TPT auditing duties, whereas the Tax Auditor is an entry-level classification. Employees in this class must be able to comprehend and interpret City of Mesa TPT and Use Tax laws, as well as Federal, State of Arizona, and other Arizona municipalities' TPT and Use Tax laws. The position requires a high level of communication skills since a written comprehensive report, which may be the basis for legal action, is prepared for each audit detailing the procedures followed, facts discovered, and determinations made based on these facts and applicable TPT laws. The position also assists in the training of less experienced auditors, primarily in a field setting during actual TPT audits. Employees in this class may be required to travel both in and out-of-state in order to complete assignments. Employees may progress to this classification via noncompetitive promotion after successful completion of original City probation, minimum of one year as a City of Mesa Tax Auditor, meet both the specific criteria-based promotion requirements and meet the minimum qualifications of the Senior Tax Auditor classification. This class is FLSA exempt-administrative.</p>
