<p><b>Concord (noun) con·cord | a state of agreement; harmony</b></p>
<p>
At Concord we believe that agreements are the foundation of everything - progress, possibilities and potential. That is why our mission is in our name: <i>to empower people to agree more</i>. Concord was built to eliminate the countless frictions that stand in the way of winning agreements. Those frictions not only cost time and money, they are dividing us and halting opportunities for everyone.</p>
<p>
With 95% of the world’s companies still managing their agreements through an antiqued manual process, we are disrupting this final frontier and pioneering a new way forward. Our B2B SaaS contract management solution is already empowering over 400 organizations and 220,000 users across 132 countries. And we are just getting started. If you have the passion, ambition and collaborative spirit to create a future where everyone can agree more, come and work with us.</p>
<p>
As our Marketing Operations Manager, you will oversee the day-to-day management of our marketing tech stack, drive our database management, and ensure effective seamless program execution. You’ll work closely with sales operations, demand generation, and the business development team to support a high-performance demand generation engine.</p>
