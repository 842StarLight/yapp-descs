<h2>Assistant Cafe Manager / Changemaker</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>We are a social enterprise that exists to empower individuals in their transition out of incarceration through training and employment in the specialty coffee industry. We are in need of coffee lovers that are eager to join us as changemakers within the prison reentry space!</p>
<p>We currently operate cafes located inside of three correctional facilities in Central Ohio. The next phase of our growth includes opening our first café beyond the walls of a local prison. This café will be a central component of our transitional employment model.</p>

<p><b>Step 3)</b> After 3-4 months of employment with us the individual transitions to more career-oriented, long term employment with higher pay and benefits</p>
<p>In addition to a job, we offer our graduates transitional housing and transportation assistance.</p>
<p>We will be intentionally turning over our staff on a regular basis (for good reason!) so you must love training new employees and have lots of patience. We will not compromise on quality of service or product so this will be an exciting challenge for us.</p>
