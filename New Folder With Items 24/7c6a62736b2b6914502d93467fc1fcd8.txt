<h4 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>Position Summary</b></h4>
<p>POSITION SUMMARY:<br>
The Customer Support Tech (CST) is responsible for providing front-line tech and parts support to Cub Crafters customers. The position is extremely dynamic requiring an energetic individual who is naturally customer focused. A typical work day will involve researching and selling parts, providing tech support to customers and/or their mechanics, and assisting the Customer Support Group in providing other customer-facing services as needed. In addition to having the required technical acumen, a qualified candidate will be a “people person”. While the CST performs sales and tech functions, the underlying goal is to ensure a great ownership experience for our customers. This may take many forms and demands great flexibility. The ideal candidate will possess an A&amp;P certificate and/or pertinent aviation maintenance experience as well as a background in sales and/or support. As a member of the Customer Support Group, the CST will be expected to function as a fully contributing member of a small and tightly integrated team; this cannot be overstated. This is a team environment and compatibility of personality and work ethic are critical.
