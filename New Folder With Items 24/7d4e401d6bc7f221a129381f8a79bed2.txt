<h2>2020 Summer Internship - Marketing (Advertising)</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<div>Domino’s Pizza, which began in 1960 as a single store location in Ypsilanti, MI, has had a lot to celebrate lately: we’re a reshaped, re-energized brand of honesty, transparency and accountability – not to mention, great food! In the rise to becoming a true technology leader, the brand is now consistently one of the top five companies in online transactions and 60% of our sales in the U.S. are taken through digital channels. The brand continues to ‘deliver the dream’ to local business owners, 90% of which started as delivery drivers and pizza makers in our stores. That’s just the tip of the iceberg…or as we might say, one “slice” of the pie! If this sounds like a brand you’d like to be a part of, consider joining our team!</div>

<p>We consider our interns to be our future team members, and we have built our program to reflect this. Our Interns are given project-based work – no making copies all summer. Each intern is given clear objectives to meet, participates in Lunch and Learn sessions with the Leadership Council and has the opportunity to attend multiple team-building activities. Summer ends with our interns giving presentations on what they learned to our Executive Team (including the CEO!) and other key stakeholders in the organization. Our paid internships run from May 2020 – August 2020. To be considered, all candidates should have a GPA of 3.0 or higher.<br>
