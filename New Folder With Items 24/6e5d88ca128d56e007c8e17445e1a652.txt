<p><b>OUR STORY:</b></p>
<p>
Brooklyn Boulders opened on September 9, 2009 in Gowanus, built out of the old Daily News Garage with a passionate group of early adopters. From there, an incredible community was born, and we realized we had something special on our hands- BKB was more than a climbing gym, it was a second home for many to bring their passions to life. Each Brooklyn Boulders thereafter became an improved iteration, and we’re continuing to innovate to inspire people to live their best lives possible, through physical potential, arts and culture, innovation and diversity.</p>
<p>
We live and breathe our core values - they are the heart of what makes Brooklyn Boulders.</p>
<p><b>
INSPIRE</b></p>
<p><b>
GET WEIRD - </b>Be yourself. BKB is your creative playground.</p>
<p><b>
CO-CREATE - </b>Trust your team. Results are stronger when we collaborate.</p>
<p><b>
BE RELENTLESS - </b>Attitude is everything. Take risks. Fall hard. Get back up.</p>
<p><b>
MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL - </b>Create something extraordinary. Be proud to share it. Never stop improving.</p>
<p><b>
MAKE IT AN OPEN HOUSE PARTY</b> - Encourage diversity and inclusion.</p>
