<h2>Senior Cloud Solutions Architect</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Join SADA as a Sr. Cloud Solutions Architect!
<br><br>
Your Mission
<br><br>
As a Sr. Cloud Solutions Architect at SADA, you will work collaboratively with other architects and engineers to design, prototype and lead the deployment of scalable Google Cloud Platform (GCP) architectures. You will work with engineering teams, customers and sales teams to qualify potential engagements, craft robust architectural proposals, and deliver Statements of Work (SOWs) that engineering teams can successfully execute. You’re also hands-on, able to conduct experiments and build functioning prototypes that prove out ideas and build confidence in the solutions you advocate.
<br><br>
You will be a recognized expert within SADA and will develop a reputation with customers as well as the Google Cloud sales and professional services organizations for the quality of your work. You will demonstrate repeated delivery of project architectures that other engineers and architects demur to you for lack of expertise. You will also lead early-stage opportunity technical qualification calls, as well as lead client-facing technical discussions.
<br><br>
Pathway to Success
<br><br>
<b>#BeAChangeAgent:</b> You are a rainmaker! You are way out in front of our delivery organization, meeting with the spectrum of corporate and enterprise customers that need our consultative services. You have your finger on the pulse of their technical needs and take pride in helping them solve their real-world problems on GCP.
<br><br>
You will be measured quarterly by a combination of (a) the volume of signed SOWs that you shepherd through the sales funnel, and (b) the level of customer satisfaction measured at the end of each engagement.
<br><br>
As you continue to execute successfully, we will build a customized development plan together that leads you through the solution architecture or management growth tracks.
<br><br>
Expectations
<br><br>
Required Travel - 30% travel to customer sites, conferences, and other related events.
<br>Customer Facing - You will interact with customers on a regular basis, sometimes daily, other times weekly/bi-weekly. Common touchpoints occur when qualifying potential opportunities, at project kickoff, throughout the engagement as progress is communicated, and at project close. You can expect to interact with a range of customer stakeholders, including engineers, technical project managers, and executives
<br>Training - Ongoing with first-week orientation at HQ followed by a 90-day onboarding schedule. Details of the timeline can be shared.
