<h2>Enterprise Account Manager - East</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">For the last 100 years, companies have operated primarily under a product-centric business model, where the goal was to make, ship, and sell more units.

This is the end of ownership and it changes everything. Our vision is "The World Subscribed" where one day every company will be a part of the Subscription Economy® (a phrase coined by our CEO, Tien Tzuo).
