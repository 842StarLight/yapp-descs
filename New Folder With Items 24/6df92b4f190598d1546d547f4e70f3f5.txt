<b>Are you a Brightstar?
</b><br>
Next Wireless Group is a subsidiary of Brightstar Corp. that leads the global, online sales of used wireless devices direct to consumers.
<br>
<br>
It's an important part of the bigger picture for us as we handle every stage of a mobile device's lifecycle for our customers-from the moment it's manufactured to trade in and re-sale, and everything in between.
<br>
<br>
This industry moves fast. But so do we. What's innovative today might become outdated tomorrow, so we have to be able to see the big picture and sweat the small details. Doing that successfully takes trust, teamwork and a knack for making the complicated simple.
<br>
<br>
We're looking for creative, quick and relentless talent to join the team. Are you one of us?</div></div>
