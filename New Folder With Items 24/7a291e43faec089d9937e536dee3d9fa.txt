<p>INFORMATION ABOUT JAZZ ST. LOUIS</p>
<p>The mission of Jazz St. Louis is to lead our community in advancing the uniquely American art of jazz through live performance, education, and outreach. Jazz St. Louis was born in August 1995 when the late Barbara Rose and Peter Bunce of Grand Center began presenting jazz musicians of national and international fame in a small, intimate atmosphere. The new music series was called Jazz at the Bistro. Following her death in 1998, Gene Dobbs Bradford was chosen to lead the organization, and he began expanding the musical styles presented and began building the education and community programs that are now an integral part of the organization. In 2006, the name of the organization was changed from Jazz at the Bistro to Jazz St. Louis to better reflect our focus on performance, education and community engagement. In October 2014 following an $8.5 million capital campaign, the Bistro and the adjacent building were renovated as the Harold &amp; Dorothy Steward Center for Jazz. JSL is an exceptional, successful arts model in the United States--one of only a few nonprofits in the country that presents jazz, educates future audiences, and nurtures budding musicians. JSL has reached over 180,000 students through its educational programming and serves one of the most diverse populations of any arts organization in the area. The Missouri Arts Council named JSL as Missouri's Outstanding Arts Organization for 2011. Additional information is available on our website at www.jazzstl.org</p>
