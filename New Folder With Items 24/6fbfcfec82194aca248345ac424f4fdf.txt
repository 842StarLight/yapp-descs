<h2>Sales Entrepreneur for Early Stage Enterprise SaaS Corporation</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>BellHawk Online Inc. www.BellHawkOnline.com provides software in the Cloud to enable small to mid-sized manufacturing, food and pharmaceutical processing, construction and other industrial organizations to transition from using paper forms and manual keyboard data entry to using technologies such as barcode scanning, mobile computing, and IIOT for tracking and managing their production operations.</p>
<p>We have established, proven software in which several million dollars has been invested, with a small number of happy customers and a small number of channel partners who resell our software as part of systems they provide to their customers. The job of the sales entrepreneur is to work with our current small technical, marketing, and support staff to grow both our direct and partner channel sales.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that, as sales grow, the sales entrepreneur will transition to a sales manager role and grow a sales organization for both the direct and partner sales channels.</p>
<p>BellHawk Online is still in the "bootstrapping" phase and, as such, pays its senior team members modest salaries. It does, however, present a major opportunity for equity participation, with the potential for the sales entrepreneur being able to make several million dollars in capital gains over the next few years. Also, as BellHawk Online is already profitable with high gross margins, it is anticipated that the direct compensation for the sales entrepreneur will grow rapidly as sales increase.</p>
<p>While BellHawk Online is sold directly using an inbound sales approach supported by online advertising, it is anticipated that significant travel throughout the USA and Canada will be required to meet with channel partners and to attend channel partner meetings organized by large equipment manufacturers and their distributors.</p>
<p>The market for our software is estimated by organizations such as Gartner to be in excess of a Billion dollars but our ambitions are smaller, as there is also significant competition. Most of the big competition is focusing on the high end of the market. BellHawk Online is focusing on the needs of the hundreds of thousands of smaller industrial organizations where 80% of all prospects are still using paper forms and manual keyboard data entry into Excel spreadsheets to track their operations.</p>
<p>BellHawk Online's competitive advantage is its ability to deliver low cost automated data collection and tracking solutions that are easy to use and quick to implement through its innovative use of Cloud and mobile computing combined with the use of IIOT devices.</p>
