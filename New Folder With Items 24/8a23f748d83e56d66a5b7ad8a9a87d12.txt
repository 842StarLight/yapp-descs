<h2>Client Services Lead</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT?
<br><br>
You want to work with passionate, creative people who love to solve problems. You set expectations and deliver on them weekly, sometimes daily. You deserve to get something more than a paycheck in exchange for all of your hard work. You want to be proud of what you do, and you deserve a team that also wants to create amazing experiences using software.
<br><br>
WE WANT YOUR BRAIN
<br><br>
Anyone can program. What we can't teach is raw intelligence and a personal desire to be great. We want craftspeople who understand their tools, who can learn from one another to advance their craft. You understand that software, programming languages, and operating systems are tools that are designed for specific jobs, and you have no problem with picking up new tools that accomplish what you need. We want your perspectives, your ideas, your intellect. We need you to make the best decision for you and your team.
<br><br>
WE EXPECT YOU TO WIN
<br><br>
Everyone at Metova is given the tools and resources they need to succeed at their job. In exchange for a great place to work, we expect you to build amazing software for our customers and amazing talent for us. You will be expected to build a compelling and easy to use interface, ensure its maintainability and ease of use, and suggest ways to improve the look and feel of the application. We are lean, which means we reflect on what we learn and use that new knowledge to quickly make better products. Your job is to keep learning, contribute your knowledge back to the rest of the team, and apply what you learn to make Metova even greater.
