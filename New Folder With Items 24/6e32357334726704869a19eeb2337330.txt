<p><b>About Greenworks Lending</b></p>
<p>
Greenworks Lending is a rapidly growing company with the goal of changing how our country's buildings produce and use energy. We finance clean energy retrofits and clean new construction on commercial building through an innovative program called C-PACE (Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy). C-PACE is a public-private financing mechanism through which private lenders provide low-cost, long-term funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy and water conservation projects in commercial properties. C-PACE financing is repaid as an assessment on the property's regular tax bill and processed the same way as other local public benefit assessments have been for decades. C-PACE is gaining traction among real estate owners and developers who are incorporating this specialty financing into their capital stacks.</p>
<p>
Greenworks Lending is the nation's leading C-PACE provider, currently active in 19 states and the District of Columbia. We have offices in Darien, CT (HQ), New York, NY, Bethesda, MD and San Francisco, CA. We are scaling our company to meet the growing demand for C-PACE financing, and we are currently hiring a Finance Manager/Associate to support our Principal Transactions team.</p>
