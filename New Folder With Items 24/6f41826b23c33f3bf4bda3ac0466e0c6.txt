<p>The Strategy and Operations team is a high-performance team chartered with assisting the Industries &amp; Partners Senior Leaders in driving the Indirect Business Model forward. This involves providing a mix of sound strategic advice combined with practical operational insight. We work on the most pressing issues for the business and we have very hands-on involvement in making the fast-paced business unit a success. This role sits at the center of our Product, Sales, and Alliances teams working with some of the most interesting companies and startups in the ecosystem. The pace and environment feels more like a start-up than a big corporation.
</p>
<p>The individual in this role will share responsibility for driving the continued success of Salesforce by supporting our ISV (Independent Software Vendor) and Cloud Reseller Partners Growth Strategy. Sample projects you will work on range from the very strategic to the very operational: evaluate market opportunities in foreign countries &amp; emerging products, growth strategy, business planning, market segmentation, sales pipeline analysis, performance review and the regular blocking and tackling of sales. The teamâ€™s deliverables range from robust analytic models, custom performance analysis, scalable reporting infrastructure, and the packaging of findings into presentation-ready content for Salesforce executives. The candidate will interact with various areas of the organization and align to senior executives.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We work in an environment with complex business issues that are not always clearly defined, and the path to a solution often involves additional data/organizational challenges and competing priorities. The successful candidate will have a relentless curiosity, possess a passion for creating innovative analysis to identify opportunities, and excel at developing recommendations that transcend the numbers. They will possess creative problem-solving skills, have a strong analytical background, be a self-starter, and be comfortable navigating complex, multi-function initiatives. As the leader of Indirect Partner Strategy, this position will manage a team of 6-7 people. The background of the team includes a mix of top tier strategic consulting (Bain, BCG, etc), financial institutions, strong operational experience in both large blue chip companies as well as cool start-ups and deep knowledge of the Enterprise Business Partner Ecosystem (SIs, ISVs, VARs, etc).
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The successful candidate will have an innovator's mindset, with a strong aptitude for understanding the big picture and translating it into tactical action. Moreover, they will excel at developing recommendations to address business issues and garnering the support to execute. Ideally, this person will have worked at a top-tier management consultancy or internal strategy role, and will feel comfortable interacting with senior management on a regular basis.
