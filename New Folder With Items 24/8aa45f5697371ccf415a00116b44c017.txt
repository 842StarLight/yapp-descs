<div>Hey statistics savants and math wizards, analyze this: can you look at a haystack of data and tease out the needles of insight? Do you relish a future brimming with big data, AI and machine learning? If you’re ready for an opportunity to tell stories with data that drive multimillion-dollar advertising decisions, then this is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.</div>

<div><b>Role Overview</b></div>
<div>As a Marketing Analyst, you will expand your analytical skills through daily exposure to big data while being challenged to identify impactful insights that shape marketing strategy.

We are maniacal about solving problems, getting to the right answer and finding new insights that lead to marketing growth. You will use your intuition and a desire to apply data to make things happen. You must be humble, hungry and smart to be confident in what you know and curious enough to ask about what you don’t know.</div>
