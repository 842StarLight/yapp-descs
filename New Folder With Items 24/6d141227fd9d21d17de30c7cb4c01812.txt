<h2>Paid Growth Marketing Lead</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">About the Role
<br>--------------
<br><br>
You love performance marketing that drives results in the forms of traffic and leads. You're equal parts left-brain (numbers, data, optimization) and right-brain (design, creative). You also understand that growth is equal parts quantity (big lead numbers) and quality (the right leads). You've had the privilege of managing a large ads budget for awhile now (MMs of $) and want to do it again for a company that makes products you're passionate about.
<br><br>
You'll own our paid spend (Search PPC, display, paid social, retargeting, YouTube, 3rd party ads &amp; syndication, etc.) all up. Each month, you'll ensure that the millions of dollars we spend on paid introduce high quality traffic into our marketing funnel - initially, you may be asked to manage this spend yourself, but as the program scales and we continue to drive good results, we may be able to justify bringing on an agency. You'll be measured on not only # of leads, but # of meetings &amp; pipeline $ generated through paid spend. You'll work with our content, demand, design and product marketing teams to ensure that our website converts at a high rate. You're relentless about A/B testing and are hungry about continually upping our conversion rate from ads all the way to form fill.
<br><br>
What You'll Do
<br>--------------
<br><br>
You'll work with the Head of Demand Generation as well as partner with content, product marketing, design (2 in-house dedicated to marketing), customer marketing as well as sales leadership to run Lattice's top-of-funnel digital campaigns that drive a large volume of high quality leads. You'll own paid spend across all digital media channels: Search PPC, display, paid social, retargeting, YouTube, 3rd party ads &amp; syndication, etc. You'll own conversion rates on the website and all of our landing pages. This is initially a roll-your-sleeves up kind of role - you'll be asked to dive into day-to-day management of our ad platforms, work with 3rd party vendors to make sure our 3rd party placements are optimized, work in apps such as Sumo, Instapage, and Drift to make optimize our digital pages for better conversion. You'll work closely with marketing ops to understand the impact of our paid spend and help make decisions on where we should invest in next. You're not afraid to dive into Google Analytics and marketing automation platforms to pull the reports you need in a pinch.
<br><br>
Last but perhaps most importantly, you'll have the support of a world-class executive team as well as be able to work with a group of A+ marketers.
<br><br>

<li>Own conversion rate optimization on our website as well as all digital landing pages</li>
<li>Play a critical role in Lattice's pipeline growth. This is a highly visible, cross-functional role as your work will impact sales pipeline directly.

<li>Help support strategic initiatives like product launches, tradeshows, customer marketing, and "big rock" content by owning our top of funnel awareness paid strategy.</li>
</ul>
Qualifications
<br>--------------------
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>5+ years working in growth-type roles. B2C experience is welcomed, however, the candidate should demonstrate B2B marketing aptitude as well and know that the two are different ballgames.</li>
<li>Deep hands-on ad platform management including but not limited to Google Ads, LinkedIn, retargeting (AdRoll, Marin Software, Criteo, etc.), Twitter, Facebook, etc. You should have experience managing 6-figure+ monthly budgets.</li>
<li>Experienced with conversion rate optimization techniques and data models. You'll have access to large datasets from tools like Segment &amp; Google Analytics - you'll be asked to design &amp; test landing pages based on this data that continually convert at a higher rate. You should be able to create high-fidelity pages in CMS's, landing page tools (Instapage, etc.) as well as overlay tools (Sumo, etc.). You should be able to dive into tools like VWO &amp; Optimizely to manage our digital A/B tests.</li>
<li>Must be a proactive &amp; great communicator up, down, and laterally.

<li>Attention to detail is very important in this role - paid ads is by far the biggest line item in the marketing budget, so every little detail counts to make sure we get the best ROI!</li>
<li>Never satisfied - there is always something else to tweak and optimize. We love you if you're always curious &amp; asking questions, then looking up the answer to see if it confirms your hypothesis.</li>
