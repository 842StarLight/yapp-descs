<br>Job Benefits
<br>------------
<br><br>
At Gainsight, we don't believe in doing things as a "means to an end." Life's too short to have anything short of a joyful work environment that we passionately believe in. We think that "work vs. life" is a false choice created by pundits, cynics and consultants. We also believe that any community (like a company) needs a ton of diversity and a very small number of things that bring us together.
<br><br>
Here are Our 5 Values
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Golden Rule: We try to practice the Golden Rule ("Do unto others..." and that sort of thing) by exercising reliability, trust and giving back to each other and our community.</li>
<li>Success for All: We believe that success for our stakeholders—whether our teammates, clients or shareholders—comes with a sincere focus on continuous learning, selfless teaching and making a difference in each other's lives.</li>
<li>Child-like Joy: We aspire to experience child-like joy in our work and lives, injecting a spirit of passion, optimism and laughter into everything that we do.</li>
<li>Shoshin: We believe in a beginner's mind. Don't surround yourself with people like you--diversity breeds creativity.</li>
<li>Stay Thirsty, My Friends: We believe in a totally internally-driven strive for greatness. The solution is think more, not doing more.</li>
</ul>
Why You'll Love It Here
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Our Attitude: We've created a new industry from scratch, and we're on the fast track!</li>
<li>Our Leadership: We offer the leading tech solution for driving Customer Success.</li>
<li>Our ROI: Reduce customer churn, increase up-sell, and improve customer satisfaction.</li>
<li>Our Technology: Deep Salesforce.com hooks, predictive analytics, and a beautiful user interface.</li>
<li>Our Impact: We help our customers make millions of dollars more per year.</li>
<li>Our Clients: Big companies like Box, Adobe, Marketo, and many others.</li>
<li>Our Team: Tech all-stars from Facebook, Box, and others (and top consulting firms like BCG and McKinsey!).</li>
<li>Our Values: They are unique - Golden Rule, Success for All, Child-like Joy, Shoshin, and Stay Thirsty, My Friends.</li>
<li>Our Office: If you showed up one day, you might find anything from karaoke performances to mini-golf championships.</li>
</ul>
