The Job</b></p>
<p>
Your primary job is to help HireVue’s sales team hit their numbers… simple as that. Their goals are ambitious, so hang-on! You do this through working with sales reps to construct and process sales orders. You work with our Contracts and Professional Services teams to coordinate the terms, pricing, and documents needed for our Sales Team. You work with the exec team to keep them updated on sales team progress. You build-out SalesForce reporting that helps us to understand our successes and failures.</p>
<p>
You are the right person for this job because you care about accuracy and you seamlessly combine this with speed and efficiency. You do not accept the status quo, rather you enjoy thinking deeply about the ways in which things are done and continually work to streamline our processes and reporting. You are a team player – always willing to jump in and help, whether it be creating sales territories for our reps, running reports to clean-up data in Salesforce, or even hopping on a call to help a rep structure a deal, you show up with a smile and roll-up your sleeves.</p>

Requirements</b></h4>

<p>
Below are a few of the traits and experiences we are looking for in this role. Let us know if this resonates!</p>
<ul>
<li>You have used Salesforce.com to do your job. You don’t have to be an expert Salesforce Admin, but if you are an advanced user, go ahead and step to the front of the queue.</li>
<li>You are smart and adaptable… of course.</li>
<li>You are the one who people can count on to get the job done.</li>
