 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<div>Tailored Pet Services needs an experienced leader to manage our dog walking operation in Snohomish County (Bothell, Edmonds, Everett, Lake Stevens, Mill Creek and Mukilteo). Because of the importance of the position, the duties cannot be fully described in a job posting; however, here's a quick summary.</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>
Hiring walkers</b>: You'll work closely with owner to fill open dog walker positions. You'll listen to phone interview recordings to determine who should be scheduled for an in-person interview. You'll conduct face-to-face interviews and schedule ride-a-longs with job candidates who pass initial screening. Previous experience making hiring decisions is crucial.</li>
<li>
<b>
New employee orientation</b>: You will arrange a meeting with new hires to complete their employment paperwork (W-4 and I-9 forms, plus company employment agreements). All new walkers complete a few days of training with another walker which you will schedule.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>
Team member scheduling:</b> Each employee is assigned a dog walking route which is determined by client needs. You'll create the daily schedule which will include (1) dogs they walk, (2) start times for each dog, and (3) travel times between visits. Tailored Pet Services uses a combination of technology to keep track of walks (Microsoft Excel and Power Pet Sitter). Power Pet Sitter is a cloud-based scheduling software for staff and clients which is easy to use. If you've not worked with this system before, we can train a tech-savvy candidate to use it.</li>
<li>
<b>
New clients</b>: Attracting new customers is vital to financial goals. Scheduling flexibility is necessary in order to meet with new clients occasionally in the evenings and on weekends (most clients work during the day which is why they hire us). Sales background is not required for this position; however, manager must have passion about the importance of our service to share with prospects.</li>
<li>
<b>
Customer Service</b>: We strive to avoid misunderstandings with clients or displease them in any way. Occasionally, a situation may arise when you'll need to utilize your excellent customer service skills to turn an unhappy person into a satisfied one. Five or more years customer service experience is highly desirable.</li>
<li>
<b>
Dog Walks</b>: Covering a dog walking route on a semi-regular basis is necessary to fill in for sick or vacationing staff. Being physically able to (1) sit, stand, bend, kneel, reach, push, pull, for up to periods of an hour; (2) lift, carry and otherwise move up to 50 pounds, (3) walk 3-10 miles per day, and (4) control dogs up to 100 pounds is vital. Because of the nature of our business, ideal manager has previous experience with pet care and dog handling.</li>
<li>
<b>
Social Media</b>: Communicating with our clients/public via social media is important. Manager will create monthly social media calendars to ensure brand consistency across multiple networks and generate, edit, publish and share engaging content according to schedule. Other tasks include communicating with followers, responding to queries in a timely manner, monitoring customer reviews and emailing clients to let them know their pet is being featured. Excellent computer skills required and experience with Publisher and Adobe PhotoShop highly desirable. If you haven't used these two programs, we will train.</li>
<li>
<b>
Shift</b>: Approximately between 9:30 am and 1:30 pm with occasional evening/weekend client meetings. Ideal candidate understands that the position requires flexibility which means some days you may need to start earlier or work later. Work hours will total 20 each week.</li>
