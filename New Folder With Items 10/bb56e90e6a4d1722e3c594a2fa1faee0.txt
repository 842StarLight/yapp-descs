<p><b>About Bondlink</b></p>
<p>BondLink provides a SaaS platform to bond issuers in the $4 trillion municipal bond industry. We have recently raised a large Series A, we have strong revenue growth, and we are already working with many of the largest issuers in the country.</p>
<p>While our product is finance focused, make no mistakes; internally we are a genuine tech-first startup culture.</p>
<p>Our co-founders include a serial tech entrepreneur with multiple successes and a senior ex-government official with deep experience in the wheelhouse of our product offering.</p>
<p>Culturally we provide all the startup bells and whistles, and we have a beautiful new office in Fort Point that we're looking to fill with talented people. We're looking for software developers of all experience levels to join our team.</p>
<p><b>Who We Are</b><br>
</p>
<p>We build the platform that powers investor outreach and transparency for some of the biggest Municipal Bond Issuers in the U.S., helping them optimize their borrowing costs so they can put their resources to better use for things like schools, parks, roads, and more. To give our Issuers the best advantage we can, you'll tackle new and interesting challenges every day, and you'll continually explore ways that we can shape our platform even better than we do today. We're looking for driven, enthusiastic people who value precision and thoroughness in their work, and want to help future-proof our excellent work/life balance by keeping our software reliably world-class as it continues to evolve.<br>
</p>
<p><b>About the role:</b><br>
</p>
<p>You'll join our back-end engineering team in leveraging advanced functional programming techniques to build resilient, rot-resistant software. Our software is currently written with Scala, scalaz, Free monad and Final Tagless architectures, structured functional logging and many other patterns. You may find this refreshingly familiar, or new and intriguing. In either case, we've refined an onboarding process to get you oriented with our current software quickly. For those looking to get started or move further into functional programming, many of our team have learned much of their FP skill-set here on the job, and we pride ourselves on being a supportive environment for learning and continued growth.<br>
