<p><b>Interplay </b>is a hands-on, service-driven IT management firm in Seattle and we've been in business since 2001. We provide complete IT outsourcing services for clients which range from 20 to 200 users in size. We're lean but capable, which has attracted some demanding (but very cool!) clients.</p>
<p>We use a fixed-fee approach to IT management which includes support, monitoring, administration, security management and "Virtual CIO" for a flat monthly rate. Our clients see us a natural extension of their business. They trust us to advise them on and implement solutions that will make them more efficient and profitable. And we firmly believe in a less is more approach-we actively remove unnecessary complexity from our clients' IT landscapes.</p>
<p>Right now we're in a growth phase and are looking for the right person to join our team for the long haul. We pay competitive wages, provide excellent health+vision+dental, pay for training and offer an uncommonly relaxed office environment.</p>
<p>As a team member, you'll have a lot of creative control over how you do your work and what subjects you want to train on. If you can prove yourself you won't be micromanaged, and your ideas won't be dismissed or ignored. And as the company grows you will be rewarded.</p>
