Why NovoEd?
<br><br>
Recently funded by Devonshire Investors, the Private Equity arm of Fidelity Investments, we now have the resources to further execute on our vision. This includes delivering compelling modern, cloud based learning solutions for corporate, government and educational enterprises. We are a growing, well funded startup that delivers solutions that have a real impact on improving our customers' business (and we have fun doing it!)
<br><br>
The territories are very large and you'll be able to have an impact as the company grows. We need creative sales people that can help our customers and prospects leverage the NovoEd platform for a modern and effective way to deliver a a social learning experience. It's a land and expand SaaS model where the deals can be large.
<br><br>
Our product is not an 'LMS' in the sense of what these legacy products do. We extend and enhance the learning experience to include social and collaborative experiences that are as effective as a classroom with much more efficiency and scale.
<br><br>
Your focus will be on selling our social, collaborative, online learning platform to large corporations. You'll work closely with sales leadership to set priorities and make key strategic decisions. You'll shape and influence every part of our sales process to roll out a winning strategy to impact our business. Exceeding revenue goals in the next year will be the primary driver and fuel for the continued growth of our business.
<br><br>
We're looking for a candidate who will embrace the challenges of building a business, who is excited to be part of a high growth team, and who will be creative and determined to address challenges by providing solutions.
<br><br>
You should bring a passion for sales and problem solving, an entrepreneurial mindset, and SaaS sales expertise. It would help if you've sold SaaS products to HR organizations within large enterprises, but we're open to all relevant SaaS experiences, including selling to lines of business, such as sales.
<br><br>
This is an opportunity for someone who wants to be part of something big and transformative.
