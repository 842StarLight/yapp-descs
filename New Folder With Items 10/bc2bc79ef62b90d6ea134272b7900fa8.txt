</p>Employee
<p></p>We are looking for a leader to build the Modernization Practice as part of Ensono’s expanding Consulting group.
<br>
<br>
The objective of the Modernization Practice is to help Ensono’s clients determine the best way to optimize, modernize, or, if appropriate, migrate off their more traditional IT environment. This includes mainframe- and midrange-related applications, software, and hardware
<p>· Optimize – extending the capabilities and productivity of the existing mainframe and midrange environment (e.g., COBOL optimization, use of specialty engines)<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>· Modernize – ensuring the mainframe and midrange applications are effectively integrated with the rest of our clients’ IT environments, be it public IaaS, SaaS, or private cloud (e.g., using modern APIs, applying DevOps)<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>· Migration – working with clients to assess mainframe migration options, including emulation, refactoring, and converting code onto public cloud platforms<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Director Consulting will be responsible for advising clients on their IT modernization journey, including creating and implementing statements of work. Projects will be executed with support from the rest of Ensono. He or she will work closely with Ensono’s product management and sales team to develop a go-to-market approach. To execute the projects, the Director will leverage Ensono delivery resources and third-part partners.<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Modernization Practice will be part of Ensono’s expanding Consulting group. Ensono Consulting provides proven transformational methods and tools, which will create a safe passage from the Client’s “As Is IT Estate” into a “To Be IT Estate” in which success will be defined by achieving the Client’s documented target outcomes.<br>
