<b>About Legacy Partners</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>In 2006, Legacy Financial Partners LLC (“LFP”; a division of The Legacy Companies), a Commercial Mortgage Advisory Firm, was formed to focus on arranging debt for multifamily properties. From its inception, LFP has established an enviable track record of executing construction, refinance and acquisition financing's, as well as an unsurpassed reputation for its commitment to client satisfaction. LFP has completed over $1 Billion in HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Conventional transactions. Capitalizing on experience gained, and lessons learned over the past twenty years, LFP started offering investment acquisition services in 2011 and completed its first acquisition on behalf of a Kentucky-based investor later that year. While interviewing property management companies to manage our client’s new acquisition, it became apparent that an opportunity existed in the industry to create a client-centric, “think like an owner” management company. Out of this, The Legacy Property Management Group, LLC was born. LPMG has since recruited some of the brightest, most focused talent in the industry to create a dynamic team to execute both tactically, and strategically. By combining a lender’s bottom line approach to creating value and the aforementioned “think like an owner” mentality, LPMG has very clearly differentiated itself from traditional fee management companies.</p>
