<p>
At VMware we believe that Kubernetes, and by extension Cloud Native, will transform the next generation of enterprise infrastructure and applications the way Virtualization and Java have in the past. Customers will look to containers to avoid lock in with public clouds and the industry has aligned around Kubernetes as the orchestration engine for these containers. VMware is investing in building a modern stack that focuses on this next generation of enterprise computing incorporating both traditional workloads and cloud applications with our core platform. For these reasons, we believe no one is better positioned than VMware to win in the multi-cloud era.</p>

<p>
To that end, VMware is investing in a new strategic function to activate recent investments in container orchestration, cloud workload mobility and cloud native application development.This team will be responsible for realizing our strategic direction and accelerating customer adoption of emerging technologies and our cloud native platforms. This function will be the link between engineering and professional services and will serve as a center of gravity for an ecosystem of customers, developers and partners focused on driving the VMware technology agenda.</p>
