<p>We are seeking highly motivated individuals to join our rapidly growing and exciting sales team.</p>
<p>As a leader in scholastic athletic marketing, branding and funding, Community All-Stars (CAS) is directly contracted by public high schools nationwide to market and fund their athletic departments for the purpose of alleviating budget cuts they are dealing with and to bring recognition to their athletic programs.</p>
<p>As a member of our sponsorship team, you will be tasked with cold calling prospective businesses around each high school to sell advertising and sponsorships in the various forms of media we create for the school that they then distribute to their students, parents, and community. Because we are working as an extension of the schools we are contracted with, and because we offer one of the only ways for local businesses to advertise inside of their local high school, and because part of their sponsorship is giving money back to their local school, the sale is much easier than most comparable sales positions.</p>
