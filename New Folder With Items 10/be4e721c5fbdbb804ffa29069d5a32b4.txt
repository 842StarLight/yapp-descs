This includes an agreement with Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green, two-time NBA Champion, All Star, Olympic Gold Medalist and Defensive Player of the Year, who announced a franchise development deal to bring 20 gyms to his home state of Michigan and to Illinois.</p>
<p>
Blink is an exciting and dynamic business that is still in the start-up mode. We are a passionate team with a great entrepreneurial spirit and a willingness to roll up our sleeves to get the work done.</p>
<p>
While Blink has grown rapidly and has already achieved significant profitability, the business is just getting warmed-up. Its leadership has a very lofty vision and expects explosive growth over the coming years. At a minimum, the business expects to have more than 300 locations over the next five years through a combination of corporate and franchise development.</p>
