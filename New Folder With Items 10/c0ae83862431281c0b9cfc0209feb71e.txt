 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>Company Overview:<br>
Liberty Power is a national Retail Energy Provider whose vision is to be the leading provider of smart, connected, and sustainable energy solutions in its communities. Ranked by DNV GL as one of the nation’s top twenty energy suppliers in the United States, the company is also a certified national Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) that supports its customers in the achievement of their social sustainability objectives.<br>
<br>
The company is honored to serve a broad spectrum of customers including almost twenty percent of Fortune 500 companies, tens of thousands of small and medium enterprises, some government agencies, as well as hundreds of thousands of residential customers.
<br>
<br>
Liberty Power is backed by one of the world’s largest companies with an investment grade rating, which provides broad access to financial and physical energy supply to meet customer needs. The company also has a strong reputation for operational excellence, balanced contracting terms, fair prices, and creativity in offering solutions to customers.
<br>
<br>
As an entrepreneurial company, Liberty Power embraces a culture that is “humble, hungry and smart.” Its people have low egos and are willing to do whatever it takes to meet the company’s mission and vision. They have joined the company for the fun of building the business without the politics and systemic rigidity of the larger players in the energy space. Liberty has a non-political, transparent, highly collaborative culture. People like each other and are driven, passionate and energized by the opportunity to take part in the continuous reshaping and growth of the company to meet the ever changing needs of the customer. They are also intelligent with a higher than average ability to analyze and think through options leading to the optimal outcome.
<br>
<br>
There is also an on-going quest for knowledge and willingness to challenge the status quo to continuously improve. People do what they say they will do and have a strong sense of urgency and responsibility because they understand that accountability builds trust. People that self-identify with these qualities tend to be a strong match for the company. The sales and marketing organizations play a critical role and have high accountability for carrying this culture forward into the marketplace and demonstrating the difference of working with the Liberty Power team.<br>
