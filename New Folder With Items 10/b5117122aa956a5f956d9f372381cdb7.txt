As our Enterprise Project Manager you will lead the execution of our Enterprise and Partnership strategy. You will compliment Sales, BD and Product staff and will truly be empowered to marshal any internal resources on behalf of our partners/clients, whether it be pre or post sale. While taking on this role, you will be able to get access to resources, define project requirements, manage trade offs, keep stakeholders accountable, meet deadlines, and communicate at the executive level with project status and risk. Cross-functional internal team management is a huge part of the role, just as much as externally representing Calm’s ability to deliver for partners and clients with precision and effectiveness.</div>
