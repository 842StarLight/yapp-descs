Watchfire Signs is an 85+ year old company that is rapidly growing as an industry leader in the cutting-edge technology of digital LED signs. Our electronic message centers (EMCs) are designed for 24/7 outdoor signage use in all weather conditions. These cutting-edge outdoor LED displays may be as small as a time-and-temperature sign at a local bank or as large as 15'x50' and beyond. Our on-premise division sells to sign companies and dealers who re-sell our EMCs as a portion of a complete signage / business identity package for their customers.</p>

Vertically integrated, Watchfire does everything from product engineering and circuit board assembly through final product integration and calibration. Post-sale, we provide world-class technical service and support. This allows us to sustain our position as the quality leader and the premium provider in our industry.</p>

<p>A territory manager is responsible for developing and strengthening a network of Watchfire sign dealers within his assigned territory. A territory manager must work closely with sign company sales reps, visiting end user prospects and providing on-site sign demonstrations and presentations.

Watchfire provides each territory manager with the tools necessary to be successful. Where other field salespeople might consider themselves lucky to have a sub-compact company car, Watchfire's territory managers are driving the industry's finest demonstration vehicles with actual full-size operating signs onboard. A professional base salary is combined with generous commissions for exceeding base sales goals. Our inside sales support staff keeps communications and materials flowing smoothly, leaving the territory managers free to focus on customer relationships and sales growth.</p>
