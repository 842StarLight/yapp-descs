<p>This job calls for regular physical activity—repetitive bending, lifting, standing, stooping, walking, and so on. It is important for the Sales Associate to exhibit a strong work ethic and a sense of urgency for the whole of each shift. The right candidate has the ability to hold and restrain animals and work near dander, disinfectants, and excretions. Similarly, he or she feels comfortable working with a variety of dog breeds—including large breeds—and cats. Overall, working with animals is a lot of fun, but it takes compassion and patience, too. Of course, the Sales Associate must have great communication skills to help him or her interact with clients and explain the benefits, features, and prices of products and services. Above all, he or she should share our love of animals and support our mission.</p>
