Who We Are</b><br>
At Geiger, why we do things and how we do them are inexorably one - achieving quality through craft, celebrating materiality through elegant simplicity, improving the work environment with beautiful furniture designed to endure. Our people do more than power our teams, they also empower each other. Ask any team member and they're likely to tell you that they may have come to Geiger for the opportunity, but they stay at Geiger because of the people. It feels like family.<br>
<br>
That family-feel is important to us, but Geiger is also able to offer big company benefits thanks to our relationship with Herman Miller. We were acquired by Herman Miller in 1999. Today, we share the same cultural values - contributing to strong communities, celebrating inclusiveness and diversity, promoting health and wellness, and working toward our Earthright environmental goals - as Herman Miller, a nationally recognized leader in the areas of family benefits, work-life balance, occupational safety, and corporate equality. If a culture of problem-solvers sounds like the place for you, then you may want to explore career opportunities at Geiger.
