<p>You will concentrate on helping your development team understand requirements by documenting user stories and behavior which in turn will help you craft the feature structure and success criteria required to address real world use cases. By using this information to create a Product Positioning statement and Product Requirements Document that supports a coordinated development program and theme, you will help OSIsoft remain informed as your features progress toward release.
