At Databricks we work on some of the most complex distributed processing systems and our customers challenge us with interesting new big-data processing requirements. As the complexity grows for both us and our customers, we are looking to our solution architects to fully understand the architecture that powers our product and how it can be implemented. Our solutions architects not only work with technologies such as Apache Spark, Hadoop and Kafka but they also recommend product features and contribute to open source community. Our solutions architect position is a pre-sales and post-sales position where you will work with customers to identify use cases for Databricks, and see them through using the product. Our customers are highly technical, so you must be too.
