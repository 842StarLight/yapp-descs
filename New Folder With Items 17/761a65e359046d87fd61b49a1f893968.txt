<p>“I believe in the concept that you learn by teaching”</p>
<p>Stephen Covey, the author of ‘The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People’ said that, and as a Sales Trainer we’ll help you to always learn to teach to the best of your abilities.</p>

<p>Well, as an accomplished Sales Trainer, you’re fundamental in the success of the future Rockstar’s joining the business. You’ll run engaging, creative, facilitated classroom sessions using our induction programme to onboard and induct people effectively.</p>
<p>You’ll teach them about the company, the product, how to use it and ultimately how to sell it. Using past experiences and knowledge, you’ll train them in the ways of all things inside sales, whether it’s handling the gatekeeper, the pitch or the objection handle, you’ll be there to show them how.</p>
<p>Following on from the induction, you’ll deliver refresher training to the Sales Team ensuring that they’re always more knowledgeable than they were before. By upskilling the team, you’ll maintain the expectations and goals of the business, whilst also supporting others to hit and exceed their own.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, you’ll need to validate and reinforce learning that’s been taught and be able to evaluate the results.</p>
<p>You’ll need to have facilitated training experience, within a classroom setting and ideally within a phone-based, inside sales environment. You’ll have a successful training background, a forte for stakeholder relationships and the drive to breed success.</p>
