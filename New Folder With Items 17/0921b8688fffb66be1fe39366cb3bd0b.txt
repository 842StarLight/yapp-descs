<p><b>What you’ll be doing...</b>
</p>
<p>Verizon is investing in its network to improve the way we live, work, and communicate. Our network transformation will be critical for all our future connectivity businesses including new products such as IoT, 5G, and future smart cities. As part of this network transformation, you will help build one network engineered for growth for all lines of business.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The OSP Planner will take corporate architecture guidelines; will review existing Verizon Network infrastructure, current business drivers, as well as future market growth opportunities to develop high level, market specific, designs of front haul fiber and transport backhaul networks.</li>
<li>
The team will also provide high level Optical Distribution Network (ODN) designs that will support Verizon’s access to small, medium and enterprise customers, long distance traffic, and back-haul requirements for wireless cell sites and hubs.</li>
<li>
The high level designs will include recommendations regarding the type /size of transport and aggregation equipment required to support each sites. A critical aspect of this team is to ensure that high level designs provide a consistent design approach across all market areas.</li>
<li>
The OSP Planner will continue to work closely with Regional Engineering to make adjustments to the design as site specific challenges present during the detailed design and implementation phases of the project. The planner will serve as a liaison between Regional Engineering/ Capacity Management and the PMO, Network Planning and the Standards teams.</li>
<li>
The Planner will vet new sales opportunities, monitor and manage the capacity of the new network, initiate growth projects, and will support IEN – ODN connectivity.</li>
<li>
Knowledge on long-term vision of Verizon’s transport and Optical Distribution Networks to effectively design for the future. This resulting network will support both customer driven and Verizon internal requirements, including Private IP, Public IP, Video, VoIP and Wireless traffic. As high level designs are developed, considerations such as space-constrained and/or power-constrained locations, available fiber, diversity, reliability and cost effectiveness, must be cared for.</li>
