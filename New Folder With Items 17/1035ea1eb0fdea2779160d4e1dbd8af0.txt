<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>AwardSpring is an established and fast-growing Software as a Service (SaaS) provider that partners with colleges and foundations to help them award scholarships and grants. We want to make it as easy as possible for students to apply for and receive scholarship money, and as easy as possible for institutions to deliver that money and raise more money for future students.</p>
<p><b>Our Values</b></p>
<p>Bias for Action: We are a small team that is in full growth mode at the moment. We all wear a lot of hats (figuratively) and we have a deep appreciation for showing ownership and accountability to our peers (literally).</p>
<p>Find A Way: We have found that there is not always an easy answer to every question or issue that arises. Yet, we strive to be creative and find a way to simplify things every day. Together, we find a way to remove every roadblock.</p>
<p>Be Human: After all, we are people (robots â€“ please do not apply). We like to have a human voice and show empathy and friendliness to everyone we interact with.</p>
<p>Keep Improving: We accept that we are not perfect, but we strive to get a little bit better every day. Hopefully you do too.</p>
<p><b>Who You Are</b></p>
<p>You have a passion to connect with people. You want to understand how those you serve define success then create solutions to help them reach their goals, whether they are fellow employees, customers or the constituents those customers serve. You understand that relationships are key to growth.</p>
<p>You want to build on the success you've had in other organizations but bring that value to a smaller, faster-growing organization where you can have a deeper, more meaningful impact.</p>
<p>You are process-driven and not afraid to have difficult discussions. You'll create a set of processes and standards to ensure customers hear from us on a predictable schedule, and you won't back down from conversations when you know they'll be tricky.</p>
<p>You have grit and a desire to serve. You approach achievement as a marathon marked along the way by a series of wins and losses, both of which you learn from. You understand that your work doesn't always yield a desired result on the first conversation, but you work to build trust and partnership over time to create a real foundation and value to everyone.</p>
<p>You build bridges. You're excited by the fact that this role sits at the crossroads of sales, marketing, service and product and welcome the challenge that comes with such a role.</p>
<p>You have a 4-year college degree and at least 3-5 years of professional experience in any type of customer-facing role.</p>
