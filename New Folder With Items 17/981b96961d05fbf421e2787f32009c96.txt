<p><b>ROLE SUMMARY
</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Assess, define, develop, implement and sustain completely novel global commercial operations service model and shared services strategies and services, including but not limited to: global service model development and standards, demand planning, global metrics and KPI development, process excellence and project management, transition management, and change management within Global Commercial Operations (GCO), the Chief Business Office, Global Business Units and Global Enabling Functions, as GCO goes about standing up a new Service Delivery Center framework and within that a Global Operations Services framework across multiple locations globally. Directly lead and contribute to global operating model transformation, speed to market, significant reductions in budget and efficiencies, and operational long-range value delivery at enterprise levels for Global Commercial Operations and Pfizer’s Business Units. Impact spans the full ~$300M direct GCO global budget as well as over $1B in GCO/BU global stewarded spend.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Leads assessment, research, design, ideation, development, execution, and measurement of novel commercial shared services delivery models and center strategies that will include: uplifting select services from COE or market level delivery, standardizing services and facilitating creation of a shared services mindset among senior GCO and business leaders, transitioning select services from existing spoke and hub models, partnering with other colleagues to include digital service delivery transformation strategies.
</p>
<p>Ideates and develops operational data so that it may be leveraged for operational insights and action planning, knowledge management, workflow, and analytics and reporting platforms specifically, across GCO, its respective global clients across Pfizer.
</p>
<p>Co-develops and institutionalizes change management strategy and tactics across GCO and BU clients to ensure goals of transformation are met through the right tools, listening, communications, stakeholder engagement, user experience, and success measures. Supports execution of the change strategy which requires heavy insight and influence in often contentious or difficult situations at some of the highest levels of the business and GCO in order to drive changes in GCO service delivery.
</p>
<p>Executes responsibilities across program development &amp; management, functional delivery, and business partnership domains with senior GCO and Business Unit (BU) stakeholders in a new functional area of exceptional complexity requiring a high degree of ingenuity, creativity, business, analytic, operations, shared service strategy expertise, and influence.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Deploys significant leadership, influence, and transformation management capability in unusually complex interactions across multiple geographies, countries, and across GCO, Business Unit and enabling function matrices. Executes both independently and as part of a solid line and complex matrix reporting team. Acts independently to uncover and resolve issues and create service frameworks, governance, change management, analytic and process and solutions associated with the development and implementation of operational programs, tools, and reporting development, and works as part of a complex, broader team. Because of the nature of GCO Services and their enablement of both marketing and sales which externally are largely immature in the shared services space, the incumbent in this role must be capable of managing a high degree of functional depth and complexity (there are over 60 discrete services in the GCO Service Catalogue) and also across multiple systems and hundreds of vendors. The incumbent for this role must possess a high degree of ingenuity to envision future models and frameworks across this complexity and for which there is no external corollary or blueprint.

<p>Pfizer reports payments and other transfers of value to health care providers as required by federal and state transparency laws and implementing regulations. These laws and regulations require Pfizer to provide government agencies with information such as a health care provider’s name, address and the type of payments or other value received, generally for public disclosure. Subject to further legal review and statutory or regulatory clarification, which Pfizer intends to pursue, reimbursement of recruiting expenses for licensed physicians may constitute a reportable transfer of value under the federal transparency law commonly known as the Sunshine Act. Therefore, if you are a licensed physician who incurs recruiting expenses as a result of interviewing with Pfizer that we pay or reimburse, your name, address and the amount of payments made currently will be reported to the government.
