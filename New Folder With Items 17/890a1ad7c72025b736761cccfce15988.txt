<h3 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>WHO WE ARE &amp; WHAT WE DO</b></h3>
<p><br>
Truvani is a health and wellness brand that has one clear mission: create products people use in their daily lives with CLEAN ingredients.<br>
<br>
Many companies claim it. We actually mean it.<br>
<br>
Our co-founder Vani Hari, better known as The Food Babe, started out as an activist who wanted to hold big companies accountable for what they put into their products. And she made tremendous progress with the help of her online following dubbed "The Food Babe Army."<br>
<br>
But after years of fighting, she realized that the only way to make a truly lasting change in the food system is to compete with these big companies head-to-head.<br>
<br>
So, she launched Truvani. We are a fast paced, high-growth health and wellness company that is looking to work with talented, ambitious people who want to create the best health and wellness products.</p>
