<p><b>About Us</b></p>
<p>
We created SalesSmyth because we knew there had to be a better way for early stage companies to build their sales organizations. We’re sales leaders and consultants, so we’ve seen firsthand the effects of building a sales team by the seat of your pants: higher burn rates, lower valuations, and less control over the future of your company. So we ask ourselves the question that drives us, “What can we do to help entrepreneurs build high performing sales teams that lead to explosive growth?” We are on a mission to deliver torrents of revenue by designing, scaling and equipping sales organizations to do their very best work.</p>
<p>
SalesSmyth is an Equal Opportunity Employer.</p>
