<b><i>Where the Chemistry Happens</i></b><p></p>
We are seeking a professional like you who is a “hands on” engineer who enjoys working on challenging CAE/FEA applications and is able to take projects through all phases of the development cycle in a team environment. In this role, you will have the opportunity to further develop and share your knowledge of plastics processing and tooling to add valuable contributions in customer project meetings and any knowledge you may have of thermoplastic and urethane material properties and mechanical behavior under various service environments. You will also demonstrate your solid understanding and knowledge of CAE technologies used in structural finite element analysis (FEA) and 3D CAD part modeling techniques to the extent of investigating, presenting relevant analysis results and answering detailed customer questions.
<p></p>You will travel to customer locations within the Detroit area with some NAFTA (Canada, Mexico) travel as project work dictates. You can expect to be at customer locations 10-30% of the time. The remaining time will be spent at the Performance Materials offices located in Wyandotte, MI. International travel may be required approximately once per year.<p></p>

<b><i>Formula for Success
</i></b></p>Leveraging your education in Mechanical Engineering or similar discipline and your experience in finite element simulations primarily using Abaqus, LS-DYNA software with a variety of structural analysis, you will help identify and develop new applications using the BASF Performance materials and primarily engineering plastics products.<p></p>
<p></p>Using your ability to translate customer requirements and needs to executable engineering problem definition for use in CAE simulations and testing requirements in the lab, you will provide CAE engineering resources to customers, during the development cycle, that include conceptual design, engineering simulations, design and testing support.
<p></p>Being a highly motivated and self-directed individual with the ability to effectively present complex technical proposals and reports, you will develop customer confidence through demonstrated expertise and expert feedback in metal to plastic conversions, which will lead to new business.
<p></p>Further developing and demonstrating your excellent understanding/knowledge of CAE and CAD technologies: FEA, NVH, 3D part modelling and your ability to conceptualize and commercialize new innovative solutions/ideas, you will develop unique on-the-shelf CAE simulation technologies that BASF can apply to customer projects upon demand.<p></p>
<p></p>Successfully engaging within the organization and being proactive in nature, you will work with the marketing and sales organization to help identify, investigate, develop and then commercialize new thermoplastic and urethane applications.
