<h2>Director of Product Marketing</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Come and design the future of Product Excellence with us.
<br><br>
WHY WE MAKE PRODUCTBOARD
<br>We started productboard because we have been inspired by product makers who have a vision. We celebrate missionaries who go for the moonshot, who stay up late at night because good enough isn’t for them. They don’t do easy, and they are not put off by failure.
<br><br>
We realized that these remarkable makers need the right tools to have the pulse of their customers, to stay laser-focused on the most important things, and to bring out the best in their teams. That is why we make productboard. We make product makers excel in everything they do.
<br><br>
Together with you, we have a unique opportunity to define and dominate a whole new category. Think the early days of Airbnb, Salesforce, Marketo, Zendesk. We can't wait to have you be part of it!
<br><br>
