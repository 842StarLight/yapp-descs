<h2>Channel Sales Manager</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>The primary role of our Channel Sales Managers is to 1) Drive field interlock between our Alliance and Channel Partners back into our sales organization 2) Education of both sales and technical resources inside our Channel Partners 3) Drive brand preference and awareness of the Nasuni brand inside our targeted customers. Our primary goal is to drive “top of funnel” opportunities through our in-direct partners by cultivating Account Alignments, Meetings, and Discovery Opportunities that our field teams can quickly move through a sales campaign. This activity will primarily be focused on existing Top and Authorized partners and from time to time recruit and onboard new partners depending on the requirements of the local territory.<br>
<p>Responsibilities:<br>
<br>
Interlock:</p>
<p>
Our Channel Sales Managers (CSM) will be responsible for a regular cadence to work with identified partners in their geography to align our target account list with the right partner who can introduce us and support us in a successful campaign with those targeted accounts. This will require the CSM to regularly gain access in offices to align our ISR’s and RSM’s with the corresponding correct people at the partners. They are responsible for driving regional management alignments with their VP, RVP, RSM’s and ISR’s. They will also coordinate escalations and coordination with the various teams as required.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Educations:</p>
<p>
The CSM’s will also need to own the partner education and enablement process for the partner to work with Nasuni in a coordinated manner. This may include putting MSA’s in place, doing on-site trainings for sales and technical resources, deal registration, pricing escalations and overall knowledge of our indirect sales motions. We have online Nasuni sales and tech training that you will need to drive our partners to. We have the educational tools and it is the responsibility of the partner managers to drive that throughout our partner ecosystem. Our CSM’s will own the partner enablement process on how best to leverage all the program tools to drive partner activity. The education of Nasuni is the foundation for our partner reps but it is the enablement that will help target joint opportunities and revenue.</p>
<p>
Brand preference and awareness:</p>
<p>
Once a partner rep is educated and enabled, it will be the responsibility of the CSM’s to drive alignment with the Nasuni field sales teams. We are a 100% channel company but, we have an active sell-with GTM strategy with all our partners. The Nasuni CSM is the connector and glue between our partner reps and field reps. We want to be viewed by our partners as the very best cloud-native file system in the world and our partners should always think of Nasuni when replacing legacy NAS or on-prem to cloud unstructured file data problems in their customers. Travel: You will be traveling to our partner offices in your regional territory. That is a key element of the role and face time in partner offices is critical. We have a Travel Smart philosophy at Nasuni. Requirements: Intellectual curiosity and professional aggressiveness are needed to succeed in this role.</p>
<p>
Living in the territory is a must and a major metro area in Chicago (or Central US) therein is ideal. <b>Channel experience is critical…either in a channel or alliances channel role.</b> Relationships with key executives, sales and technical management with partners in the territory is a requirement.<b> Private, Hybrid and public cloud experience are key…you must have worked in this space. 3-5+ years is ideal.</b> <b>Cloud and SaaS experience is a requirement.</b> We are not an HW manufacturer, we are a cloud-based SaaS solution.
