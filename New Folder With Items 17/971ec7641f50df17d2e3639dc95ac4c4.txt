A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A PROPERTY MANAGER</b></p>
<p>
As a Property Manager, you arrive each morning ready to get your day started! You are vested with the total responsibility for all phases of the operation of the community, including maximizing the long-term operating performance of your community. You collect and keep track of rent, deposits, late fees, and conduct move-out reconciliations. For prospective residents, you verify rental, employment, and credit history as well as prepare all lease documentation for new residents. You definitely have your share of paperwork to complete, but you enjoy the frequent interruptions and chances to interact with different people.</p>
<p>
You work to minimize evictions and reduce delinquency, but you do handle evictions properly when necessary. You market the property in order to fill vacancies quickly and maximize retention rates. You ensure that everything is handled according to federal, state, and local laws and regulations. You are never bored! You take pride in maintaining good relations with the residents while preparing the weekly and monthly reports. Though you spend a lot of time working independently, you also get to interact with people regularly as you communicate with our residents in order to keep our community running smoothly.</p>
<p>
Your biggest focus is on overseeing and enhancing the community's financial growth, employment and development of staff, and maintaining positive resident relations. Effective personnel management and development, a thorough understanding of the competitive market and high standards for customer service, maintaining the physical condition of the community, and operating procedures are essential.</p>
