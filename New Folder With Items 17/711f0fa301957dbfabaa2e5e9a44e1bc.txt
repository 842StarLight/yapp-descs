<p>The Organization</p>
<p>Back on My Feet combats<br>
homelessness through the power of running, community support and essential<br>
employment and housing resources. Operating in 12 major cities coast-to-coast,<br>
Back on My Feet recruits members (those experiencing homelessness) at homeless<br>
and residential facilities and begins with a commitment to run three days a<br>
week in the early morning. The second phase of the program, Next Steps,<br>
provides educational support, job training programs, employment partnership<br>
referrals and housing resources. Please click here to see our program in<br>

<br>
<p></p>
<p>Since 2007, Back on My Feet has<br>
served more than 6,000 individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness and<br>
engaged more than 100,000 volunteers and supporters. Our members have run a<br>
collective 500,000 miles and obtained more than 4,000 jobs and homes. Within<br>
six months of becoming a Back on My Feet Alumnus, 90% of members maintain their<br>
employment, 60% receive a wage increase and 20% achieve a promotion. Every $1<br>
invested in Back on My Feet returns nearly $2.50 to the local community through<br>
increased economic output from employment and reduction in costs for shelter,<br>
medical services, incarceration and drug and alcohol treatment.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>Through our innovative program,<br>
Back on My Feet proves that there is hope, that individuals can achieve things<br>
they never thought possible and that there are people who will support them<br>
along the way. For additional information, please visit www.backonmyfeet.org.</p>

<p>Our Core Values</p>
<p>Be Accountable: Goals: Own them, crush<br>
them, seek more. Others can rely on you to deliver. Maximize the impact of our<br>
donors’ investments. Own mistakes, learn from them, do better.</p>
<p>Be Bold: Innovate: Think BIG, embracing<br>
the unconventional and the uncomfortable – pushing yourself and your team.</p>
<p>Be<br>
adventurous, creative, and open-minded. Identify challenges, solve problems,<br>
create solutions.</p>
<p>Be Respectful: See the value of<br>
colleagues’ expertise and have the humility to leverage it. Recognize<br>
differences in opinion as opportunities to learn – and know when to move on. Acknowledge<br>
other’s contributions and applaud excellence. Be honest. Be transparent.</p>
<p>Be Passionate: Challenge societal<br>
perceptions of people’s capacity for growth. Be dedicated to helping others<br>
reach their potential. Strive to perfect your craft every day.</p>
<p>‘Run’<br>
Fast: Be decisive: measure and act on what matters most. Get things done –<br>
focus and operate with urgency but simplify. Be nimble and ready for change. Move<br>
with speed and purpose – but take care of YOU.</p>
<p>Win<br>
Together: Accelerate each other in pursuit of our mission. Relays are<br>
faster than individual events – embrace team efficiencies and when needed pass<br>
the baton. Never stop short of the finish line.</p>
