<p><b>SUMMARY:
</b></p>
<p>Are you ready to LEAD and make a IMPACT?</p>
<p><b>Exceptional Living Centers is looking for a Dynamic Business Development Leader!</b></p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>This position helps establish strategic initiatives supporting identified objectives, facilitating program planning, setting expectations and improving overall results. Regional Director of Strategic Initiatives position can be grouped into three models: communicator, facilitator and planner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicator First and foremost, this type of Regional Director of Strategic Initiatives (RDSI) should be relationship focused. The Communicator RDSI must be skilled at building and maintaining relationships with an acute awareness of the objectives within the STRATEGIC PARTNERS participants. Because of inherent conflicts in the provider/payer relationship, a Communicator RDSI must also be a skilled negotiator. •</li>
<li>Facilitator This RDSI role emphasizes the necessary in-depth knowledge and understanding of the STRATEGIC PARTNERS organizations, as well as their business divisions, plans and priorities. In order to effectively share information with the STRATEGIC PARTNERS participants and patients so everyone understands the process, a Facilitator RDSI must be able to streamline healthcare interactions, such as supplying dwindling medical devices or coordinating health insurance payments for regular visits. •</li>
<li>Planner must assist with the prioritization and alignment of initiatives related to the STRATEGIC PARTNERSs and business strategies. As the intermediary between payer and provider, Planner RDSIs require essential knowledge and insight into how their STRATEGIC PARTNERS operates and what improvements can be made to optimize operations to improve patient care. The RDSI models are not mutually exclusive, but each can be more effective than the others depending on an organization’s culture and maturity. Since organizations change over time, the model and relevant RDSI skills must also evolve to remain effective. A few factors to consider that could affect the STRATEGIC PARTNERS’s necessary skill set include stakeholder and executive involvement, decision making empowerment and ability to deploy enterprise-level experience systems for patients. Each model has benefits, but an Regional Director of Strategic Initiatives’ effectiveness as a go-between for patients and invested organizations can depend on the specific issues the RDSI is meant to analyze and solve.</li>

<p></p>
<ul><li>Top 5 skills Regional Director of Strategic InitiativeS:: While being relationship-focused and up-to-date on healthcare trends are both vital to being a successful RDSI, there five additional key skills for the position.
<ul>
<li>Knowledge of STRATEGIC PARTNERS quality measures RDSIs must know the ins and outs of STRATEGIC PARTNERSs in order to capitalize on efficiencies and potentially to receive lucrative reimbursements. Staying informed and on-top of new developments in measurement can provide potential savings for invested organizations and patients alike.</li>
<li>Knowledge of provider and payer Understanding the benefits of an STRATEGIC PARTNERS is only a portion of what RDSIs need to know. The other major component is knowing how the organizations within the STRATEGIC PARTNERS operate. Claim submissions, explanation of benefits and explanation of payments remittances, benefit inquiries and procedure authorizations are all business operations that RDSIs need to leverage to streamline payment and healthcare practices. The RDSI must also know these processes in a traditional fee-for-service model, and how they differ from the STRATEGIC PARTNERS model.</li>
<li>Ability to measure the value of improving business processes The current healthcare system has inefficiencies, so the RDSI must always be vigilant of ways to reorganize or create new processes that save money. The RDSI must also advocate the clinical and administrative process documentation for providing care, both episodic and bundled, to understand the true costs and how they can be reduced by improving the overall process.</li>
<li>Communication Patients of an STRATEGIC PARTNERS will be apprehensive of changes in an already complex healthcare system. The RDSI must cultivate and maintain patient collaboration with the organizations in the STRATEGIC PARTNERS. RDSIs must support a patient-centric experience before, during and following healthcare treatment, which includes payer-provider relations. For clinicians, the awareness must go beyond the episode, surgery or encounter. Transparent STARS scores, quantifiable changes, even clinician experiences at the facility should be documented and analyzed for improvement. An ideal background for a successful RDSI is having previously served on the provider side as part of a multi-plan network or from the payer side having built provider networks.</li>
<li>Compassionate advocate for patient health Quality patient care is the ultimate goal of STRATEGIC PARTNERSs. An effective RDSI will walk a mile in the shoes of the doctor, nurse, care manager, customer service rep and the patient. Then, they will prioritize with empathy to dramatically improve overall experiences. Patients, members and employers who feel like someone cares will demonstrate a higher tolerance for change if and when it occurs. In order to achieve an STRATEGIC PARTNERS arrangement that achieves desired outcomes, such as lower readmissions, shared coordination of care, lower cost of care, higher patient satisfaction and healthier lifestyles, an Regional Director of Strategic Initiatives must be the force behind proactive change. Changes to the healthcare process will not be easy, but with an experienced individual in place with the proper knowledge, skills and passion, progress will not be as challenging.
