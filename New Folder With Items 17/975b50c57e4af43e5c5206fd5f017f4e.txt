 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">**Description**
<br><br>
At Pearson, we’re committed to a world that’s always learning and to our talented team who makes it all possible. From bringing lectures vividly to life to turning textbooks into laptop lessons, we are always re-examining the way people learn best, whether it’s one child in our own backyard or an education community across the globe. We are bold thinkers and standout innovators who motivate each other to explore new frontiers in an environment that supports and inspires us to always be better. By pushing the boundaries of technology — and each other to surpass these boundaries — we create seeds of learning that become the catalyst for the world’s innovations, personal and global, large and small.

Learning Applications
<br><br>
Learning Applications is a digital product portfolio within Pearson’s Higher Ed global product group. Learning Applications are discrete, end-to-end products that provide value anytime, anywhere by increasing confidence &amp; outcomes associated with a specific learning activity or skill and benefit multiple disciplines in a standalone or integrated capacity.
<br><br>
The Learning Applications category is focused on innovation, specifically delivering consumer-grade applications via digital means (mobile, desktop, etc.) quickly to address newly evolving needs of students and instructors. As the number and usage of Learning Applications is growing, an immediate priority is to improve and increase usage of our existing portfolio, while planning and laying a strong foundation for future Learning Applications.
<br><br>
This means a modular, flexible, and interoperable approach is required of Learning Applications. Seamless integration with student workflow, whether integrating with an LMS or consumer software, will enhance Learning Applications’ - and consequently Pearson’s - value. Offering Learning Applications via a variety of use cases and contexts enables Pearson to explore new product models to better serve customers in a wide range of markets around the world.
<br><br>
