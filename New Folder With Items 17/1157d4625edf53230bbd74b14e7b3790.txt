 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p><b><i>Overview:</i></b></p>
<p>
The "Internet of Things" (IoT) is growing rapidly. Aeris is at the forefront of this industry, building networks and applications to enable leading companies in a wide range of industries, including connected health, automotive, solar and asset tracking, to collect and transmit the data that will help them understand how their devices are working and improve their businesses. Headquartered in Silicon Valley with offices in Chicago, London, Delhi, and Tokyo as well as other markets, we rank among the top ten cellular providers for the IoT globally. We're privately-held but profitable and doing well, and both our bottom line and our global reach are increasing.</p>
<p>
Aeris engineers are constantly innovating, solving industry problems, developing cutting-edge capabilities and making our networks and services more feature-rich, faster, simpler, more robust and more reliable. Much of this innovation can be protected under patent laws, and there is a strong need to add the right person to our team who will help engineers explain their inventions, create invention disclosure statements, and work with patent counsel to quickly prepare patent applications for filing and shepherd them through the prosecution process.</p>
<p>
The Manager, Demand Generation Marketing will take sole-ownership for North America (Aeris' largest geographic region) and partnered-ownership of international regions including EMEA and APAC to generate demand for our Enterprise and Mid-Market business teams to be based out of our Chicago, IL office. Responsibilities include working with marketing automation and CRM systems to manage lead input, track campaign results, analyze data, and improve processes. A deep understanding of best practices in the capture, tracking, qualifying, segmenting and reporting on leads is essential.</p>

Expertise in Hubspot is a requirement, knowledge of Netsuite is a plus.
