The Opportunity
<br><br>
One Medical's Enterprise business has been growing rapidly, and we are now searching for an exceptional Senior Account Manager to join us as a core member of our Client Services team. As a Senior Account Manager, you will own a group of mid-market and large enterprise client accounts and act as a consultative partner in delivering the One Medical benefit and shaping their healthcare delivery strategy. Our Enterprise Client Services account team partners closely with our clients (HR/benefits at great companies like Airbnb, Uber, Blue Apron, BuzzFeed, Etsy) to promote and deliver One Medical membership &amp; services as a benefit for their employees. Reporting to the Director of Account Management, you will work with the Client Services team to lead and manage a portfolio of some of our largest employer partners, and collaborate with multiple internal departments at One Medical (Operations, Marketing, Sales, etc.) to service those relationships.

Our high-performing account management team works collaboratively to share best practices, support each other, and ensure we set up each client relationship for success. We look for client managers who are exceptional communicators, with a strong presence and ability to influence/persuade a wide range of audiences and quickly establish rapport with internal and external stakeholders. Additionally this role requires strong planning and/or project management skills. Lastly, you will be set up for success if you have a demonstrated ability to manage competing priorities while consistently meeting (or exceeding) your goals and overcoming setbacks.
