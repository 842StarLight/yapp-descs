<li>Change is your middle name. Our company is constantly evolving. You embrace new ideas and change in big ways (new products) and little ways (today’s schedule).</li>
<li>You don’t expect a training manual (what a relief; there isn’t one). You learn best by observing, doing, and always improving.</li>
<li>Even procurement loves you. You have experience and a detailed nature with complex negotiations for long-term relationship management.</li>
