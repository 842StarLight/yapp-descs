<h2>Vice President of IT</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">4ocean is here to help end the ocean plastic crisis, and we are looking for our first ever Vice President of Information Technology to help us achieve our mission.
<br><br>
About 4ocean
<br>4ocean is a purpose-driven business. We clean the world’s oceans and coastlines while working to stop the inflow of plastic by changing consumption habits. Unlike many other environmentally focused companies, we are not a nonprofit, and believe in creating sustainable business solutions to achieve our goals rather than relying on donations or grants.
<br><br>
We were founded in 2017 by two surfers who dedicated themselves to cleaning the ocean and working to end the ocean plastic crisis. They launched the company by creating a handmade bracelet and promising to pull a pound of trash for every bracelet they sold. With the money raised from the sales of these bracelets, we have been able to employ hundreds of people to clean the ocean full-time and pull over 5 million pounds of trash from the ocean and coastlines.
<br><br>
Bracelet sales are just the beginning. We are building an assortment of high quality, sustainably made products that will help people reduce their dependence on single-use plastic, reuse the materials we collect from the ocean, and celebrate the 4ocean brand and ocean-conscious lifestyle.
<br><br>
Beyond our products, we combat the ocean plastic crisis through technology, cleanups, influence, and education. Our ocean clean-up operations, currently in the U.S., Haiti, and Indonesia, are meticulously documented and audited for transparency, and we are regularly expanding to new locations and deploying new clean-up technologies.
