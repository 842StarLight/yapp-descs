<p>University of Advancing Technology (UAT) is looking for a badass digital marketing professional with extensive knowledge in digital advertising and marketing campaigns, but affords with an endless desire to learn more. You are a doer and not only generate new ideas, but execute them.</p>
<p>
You build and run marketing campaigns from beginning to end, test, refine, and scale for iterative improvements. As a maven and early adopter, you will consistently seek out new opportunities, mediums, segments and channels, to make informed decisions for refinement based on data, testing and analytics. This includes analytics, site management and conversion, and all forms of digital media outlets from Hulu to AdWords. You will be managing marketing automation supporting nurture and drip campaigns, PPC and SEO. You own the content and the coordination of that content.</p>
<p>
You are fast, fun, friendly, smart and ready to hit the ground running on day 1. You have an entrepreneurial spirit, an ability to launch new products and lines of business and have an affinity for tech. You are an individual who is as excited to learn as they are to share. It’s like an agency experience in a non-agency setting; we work hard and play hard and we’re going to push you to do both. Your critical function is to engage with our young, techcentric audience, find prospective students and get them here.</p>
