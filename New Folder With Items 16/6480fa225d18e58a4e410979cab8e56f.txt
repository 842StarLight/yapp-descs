About you
<br><br>
You like to solve problems and build processes. You are eager to figure out why things are broken and turn your learnings into improved processes. People tend to describe you as a hard worker, but you would say any job that’s worth doing is worth doing well, because you care. You are curious and excited to learn about new and old technologies powering a modern factory. You are a good communicator and able to speak ‘full-stack’ from engineers to c-suite. You are able to google your way out of most problems, and understand that every customer sees the world a bit differently.
