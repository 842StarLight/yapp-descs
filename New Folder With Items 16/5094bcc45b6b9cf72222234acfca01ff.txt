 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<b>Description:</b><br>
<b>About us:</b> IONpath is commercializing Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI) technology for measuring protein expression in tissue samples with extraordinary application in immuno-oncology, immunology, neurobiology and infectious disease. Compared to existing technologies, MIBI offers significant improvements in multiplexing capability, sensitivity, sub-cellular resolution, higher throughput and enables rescanning of tissue. Researchers and clinicians can use MIBI to provide new insights into disease pathogenesis.
<br><b>About the position:</b> We are seeking an in-house Field Application Scientist to: 1) run/manage the IONpath MIBIscope Center of Excellence (COE) and provide pre-installation customer training at our Menlo Park office; 2) facilitate the capability of west coast customers to reliably generate MIBI data, as well as understand their research objectives and resolve any bottlenecks they are experiencing to ensure they get quality data on time for presenting and publications; 3) work with the sales team to provide pre-sales technical seminars and scientific consultation.
<br><br>
<b>About you:</b> You are a seasoned FAS with experience with imaging systems and imaging data. You enjoy working with next-gen technology and want to be part of enabling researchers to answer big, complex scientific questions. You're collaborative, have proven ability to troubleshoot and resolve instrument operator problems, enjoy pushing the boundaries of science, and are able to take initiative and work independently.
