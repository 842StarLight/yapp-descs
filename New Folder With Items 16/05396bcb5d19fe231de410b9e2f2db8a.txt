</b></h2>
<div><div><div>
<div>Primary responsibilities will include but not be limited to:</div>
<ul>
<li>
Promoting the culture of working safely and applying safety related concepts into process design.</li>
<li>
Establishing the design criteria, incorporating client requirements, estimate and/or scope basis and design basis meeting applicable state, local and federal standards and codes. Ensuring that any requirements for permitting have been established and communicated to the project team.</li>
<li>
Understanding and familiarity with project scope, specifications and design criteria upon assignment to a project task team.
</li>
<li>Advising the Lead Engineer of potential design or scope changes.</li>
<li>
Delegating work to engineers and designers in proportion to their technical skills and experience, then following up for support to ensure efficient progress and quality.
</li>
<li>Consulting with design leaders from other disciplines to ensure inter-disciplinary alignment on projects.</li>
<li>
Producing estimate level preliminary designs and material take-offs suitable for the level of estimate being performed on a project.</li>
<li>
Developing conceptual layouts and cost studies as necessary to determine the most ideal and efficient approach to solving engineering tasks at hand.</li>
<li>
Familiarity with and utilizing department standards, procedures, and guidelines.</li>
<li>
Producing detail design calculations and drawings for the project. Calculations produced will be neatly prepared and organized for efficient checking by others. Efficient use of designers in the development of drawings.</li>
<li>
Producing project designs that are optimal and efficient with an overall emphasis on ease of construction, operability, and maintenance. The completed design should meet the specifications and expectations of the client.</li>
<li>
Checking calculations, reports, and studies made by other engineers to ensure accuracy, as well as conformance to codes, specifications, design criteria and good engineering practices.</li>
<li>
Producing equipment and construction specifications.</li>
<li>
Monitoring drawings in progress to ensure conformance to design calculations and specifications.</li>
<li>
Assisting the designers in resolving routine layout and detailing problems. Ensuring that sufficient information and details are provided for completion of engineering drawings.</li>
<li>
Reviewing and checking vendor information and other discipline information needs for process engineering input. (You say the same thing two bullets down - Reviewing fabrication drawings and other vendor submittals for conformance to engineering drawings and specifications.</li>
<li>
Developing engineering and equipment specifications. (Engineering specifications are distinct from equipment data sheets. Mechanical Engineers write the equipment specifications in our group at Atlanta. Either they or the Process group starts the equipment data sheets.)</li>
<li>
Reviewing fabrication drawings and other vendor submittals for conformance to engineering drawings and specifications.</li>
<li>
Performing fieldwork necessary to gather process information, check tie-ins and provide construction support.</li>
<li>
Developing bid packages enabling process engineering purchase inquiries to be issued for procurement of equipment, materials or services. (This function is reserved for the Mechanical Engineers at the Atlanta office.)</li>
<li>
Participating in professional society meetings to make new business contacts and keep current with new developments in the industry.</li>
<li>
Participating in sales activities including pre-bid meetings, client presentations, scope review meetings, and proposal development.</li>
<li>
Traveling as required for client presentations, project related tasks, and training opportunities.</li>
<li>
Actively participates in the mentoring of less experienced process engineers.</li>
<li>
Developing small work sharing packages for interoffice execution support.</li>
