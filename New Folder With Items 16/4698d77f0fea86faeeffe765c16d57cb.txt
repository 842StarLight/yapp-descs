<div>Overview of prAna:</div>
<div>
From the first days designing clothing in a garage, prAna’s initial vision to connect yoga and climbing to mindful living has captivated thousands. It’s ensured that prAna clothing and gear are made with intention - that every detail from trim and linings to hangtags is carefully designed to enhance our lives today while still considering the needs of tomorrow. For more than 22 years, this vision has been at the root of prAna’s relationships with customers and retailers. And, it has helped the company to foster a community of active, free spirited customers that share its values.</div>
<div>
Today, the brand has evolved beyond our rock climbing and yoga roots to include lifestyle and performance clothing. The clothing is designed at prAna with style and versatility in mind. prAna is deeply committed to mitigating the impact they have on the environment in manufacturing and selling its clothing and that all products are made in safe and fair working conditions. Each year, prAna welcomes increasingly more people to the prAna way of life through a multi-channel strategy including its own branded stores, a fast growing direct ecommerce business, catalogs and an established wholesale distribution of over 1,400 retailers across the US, Canada, and Europe.</div>
