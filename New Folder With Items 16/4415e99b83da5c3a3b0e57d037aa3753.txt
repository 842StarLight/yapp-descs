<li>OS Atmosphere enables local guides to provide bespoke and stimulating mountain experiences to guests across the world, with partners, like Copper and Winter Park, right here in Colorado.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Only Sky, your voice is heard. There is no corporate nonsense, and we move at a fast pace.</p>
<p>To be a part of the Only Sky team means you will be held to a high standard, and expected to work independently. There will not be a lot of hand holding, but there will be a lot of teamwork, brainstorming and cooperation between departments. As a hyper growth, venture-capital backed start-up, you will grow along with the team as we continue to formalize our processes and continue to push ourselves to grow to support new verticals, customers and countries.</p>
<p>We are looking for smart, self-motivated and tech-savvy individuals to join our team and join us in taking the company to the next level.</p>
