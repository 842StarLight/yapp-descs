<h2>Director of Finance and Administration</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">We're looking for an analytical and strategic leader to lead the finance and administrative functions at BrandVerity.
<br><br>
Unlike most SaaS companies, we're bootstrapped, which means we have never raised an investment round. We are also cash flow positive and have always been. We are oriented towards growth and managing the company to a relatively low net income as we invest back into the business. You will have an opportunity to work broadly across the company and become deeply familiar with a broad range of operations at a technology startup.
<br><br>
You will report directly to the CEO, and will work in close partnership with the sales and customer success teams. You will be based in BrandVerity's Seattle office and will be responsible for financial operations across our Seattle and London offices.
<br><br>
Key Responsibilities
<br>--------------------
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Drive strategic financial insight: Identify and track the metrics that impact the business and affect the strategic growth of the company.</li>
<li>Run financial operations: You will be responsible for forecasting, budgeting, internal reporting, AR/AP management, managing our part-time bookkeeper, working with our third-party CPAs to conduct annual audit and tax filings, and presenting financial health company-wide.</li>
<li>Own G&amp;A: Manage an incredibly talented office manager, oversee benefits, maintain the cap table, manage corporate filings, and run the 409A update process.</li>
<li>Contracting: Own contract negotiations, ensure successful closure to the sales process and consult outside counsel on an as-needed basis.</li>
</ul>
Things We're Looking For
<br>------------------------
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>At least six years of broad financial and operations management experience: You have experience managing financial operations at multiple levels with increasing responsibility.</li>
<li>Contract management experience: You have negotiated contracts with limited input from legal counsel. You are familiar with common approaches to contracting and contract negotiations.</li>
<li>Proven record of designing and implementing scalable processes: You are comfortable creating scalable processes for our growing team and customer base.</li>
<li>Scrappiness: You have a demonstrated knack for operating efficiently and finding creative ways to do more with less.</li>
<li>Management experience: You have managed and supported the career and personal development of small teams.</li>
</ul>
We use a handful of tools to run the business today. Some familiarity with them will be helpful, but certainly isn't required. They include: Quickbooks, Intuit Payroll, Salesforce, and Zenefits. Similarly, experience working in a SaaS business would be helpful, but isn't required.
<br><br>
We know the confidence gap and imposter syndrome can get in the way of meeting spectacular candidates. Please don't hesitate to apply.
