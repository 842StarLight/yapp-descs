ZoomInfo, a leading B2B data company located in Waltham, MA, makes it our goal to maintain the highest security standards in our products, keeping an intense focus on product security. As a hands-on Security Engineer you will guide and influence the product security domain and ensure our product security is excellent, and our clients are safe from advanced attacks.
<br><br>
This is a soup to nuts, a highly hands-on security position. The ideal candidate will extensively probe our multiple environments – cloud, data center, offices – to identify and prioritize risks and issues ranging from firewall configurations, network firmware, OS patching and hardening, DB security, Cloud access and so much more. Then, in close cooperation with engineering management and systems engineers, develop a short and long term plan to rectify those issues through upgrades, patching, configuration changes, and tooling. Many of those fixes will fall on the Security Engineer to coordinate and, in many cases, implement where appropriate. Once the initial fixes/deficiencies have been remediated, the engineer will then be able to focus on further enhancing our security posture.
