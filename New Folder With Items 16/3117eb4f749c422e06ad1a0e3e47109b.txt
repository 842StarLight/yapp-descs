<h2>Sales & Business Development Manager</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">At Starmind, we believe that the combined knowledge and cognitive capabilities of humans far exceed any existing technology's computing power; thus, we developed AI to empower and enhance rather than replace the human mind.
<br><br>
Our platform helps expedite people's advancement by exploring undocumented human intelligence and enabling real-time access to skills, knowledge, and solutions within corporations, communities, and, since we like to think of the bigger picture: the world.
<br><br>
We are backed by some of the best VC investors in Europe, becoming one of the fastest growing AI companies in Europe; and are rapidly expanding our team with the crème de la crème from Airbnb, Twitter, Salesforce, Zuora and many more.
<br><br>
Do you have what it takes to help us shape the future of AI?
