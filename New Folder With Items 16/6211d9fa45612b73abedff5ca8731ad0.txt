<p><b>Summary
</b></p>
<p>The Vice President of Operations (VPO) is responsible for overseeing the overall senior living properties within their specified region and to advance strategic initiatives. The VPO’s main objectives include resident satisfaction, exceeding occupancy and financial metrics as well as maintaining/improving physical plants. The VPO’s ultimate goal is to continually increase each community’s value.</p>
<p><b>
Basic Purpose:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is the VPO’s responsibility to determine the areas where the Executive Director (ED) needs assistance and either train them to perform the role effectively or supplement them. However, at all times, the community and its operations are the direct responsibility of the VPO. The VPO is expected to be fully responsible for ensuring the success of each community’s (and the company’s) business plan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The VPO must consistently monitor the overall physical condition of the property by making site visits and comprehensive monthly site inspections. They should utilize and complete the company Community Inspection Checklist Form. During site inspections, it is important to see that previous items noted are satisfactorily completed as well as establishing which new items require attention. All courses of action should be documented with approximate cost and target completion date.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The VPO must assure that the ED has prioritized ongoing tasks correctly. As a manner to promote teamwork, the VPO will assist the ED in normal daily operations when necessary. If performed in a collaborative manner, this approach builds teamwork, respect and loyalty. However, the VPO must also provide ongoing coaching so that the ED may, along with their team, achieve all goals/duties independently.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is the VPO’s responsibility to keep the President informed of each community’s problems, objectives, goals and strategy and to discuss these items on a regular basis, as well as discussing personnel and areas where assistance is needed. The VPO should identify problem areas so that appropriate solutions can be researched and developed. All issues of potential liability must be brought immediately to the attention of the President.</p>
