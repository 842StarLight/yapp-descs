<p><b>About AVB Marketing: </b></p>
<p>It all started on a fishing boat…no, really. In the spring of 1969, on a small fishing boat in southern California, a few appliance and electronics retailers debated the possibility of pooling their purchase orders, so they could buy product for less and increase profitability. That summer, Associated Volume Buyers (AVB) was born. Fast forward to present day, we have more than $17 Billion, with a capital B, in annual retail sales, over 4,500 independent members and over 8,000 stores in North America. We are member-owned, not-for-profit, the fastest growing membership of our kind and a force to be reckoned with.
