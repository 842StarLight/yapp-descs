<br><br>
We’re Eargo and we’re on a mission….to help people hear life to the fullest and disrupt and transform the hearing health industry, forever! If disrupting is not something you’re looking for, we suggest you move on to the next job posting. We’re looking for those passionate individuals who jump out of bed in the morning dreaming of new ways to improve the lives of our customers while eating their corn flakes riding their unicycles to work while daydreaming of competitive unicorn jousting. So, you guessed it, we’re a different sort.
<br><br>
We’re tech geeks and dreamers. We don’t believe in the status quo. We believe that every voice is unique and every idea is worth talking about. Moreover, we believe in passion and having fun. Because it takes passion to change the world and if you have passion in what you’re doing, you naturally have fun doing it. But, we do have a serious side. Over 48 million Americans currently experience hearing loss and 80% of them do nothing about it. Their denial has many different shades, but more often than not it’s related to social stigma. We at Eargo find that un-cool! And that’s why we exist….to give people their hearing without the social stigma so that they can go on being the cool person they are. That’s why we get out of bed in the morning and we take that seriously. We also take spontaneous planking seriously…it’s a thing.
<br><br>
Does this sound like a place you want to work? Well, you’re in luck. We’re looking for some great minds to join us on our journey.
<br><br>
