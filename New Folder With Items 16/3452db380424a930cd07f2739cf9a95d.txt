You have experience in directing enterprise-wide learning and development efforts for organizations within the retail industry and ideally will have led the training strategy and implementation in a start-up environmentâ€”building the function from the ground up. You will understand what it takes to build high-impact business-relevant training programs for the broader employee population on both the fulfillment center and support aspects of the business to raise the performance bar and create a consistent, exceptional customer experience.
