<p><b>Our Philosophy: Work is the Cornerstone of Life</b></p>
<p><br>
At Goodwill, we believe that the opportunity to work can - and does - change a person’s life. A job offers the independence that comes with a paycheck, increases self-esteem, and breaks the cycle of poverty. It’s a philosophy that we have been following in North Florida since 1940, when our local organization was founded as one of a growing number of independent non-profit affiliates of what is now Goodwill Industries International. Today, Goodwill Industries is the nation’s largest private provider of training and employment services for people with disabilities and special needs. And our local organization has grown into one of Goodwill’s top performers in placing people into employment.</p>
