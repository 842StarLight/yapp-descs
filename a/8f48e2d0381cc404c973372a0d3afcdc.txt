<div>
You’ll be the ultimate relationship builder harnessing hard work, discipline, and strategic ability to prospect and build a client base of CFO's, CAO's, VP/Directors of Accounting, and Corporate Controllers. Practically, this looks like calls, emails, networking events and meeting with potential clients.
