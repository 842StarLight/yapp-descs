<p><b>ESSENTIAL DUTIES &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Analyzes contract requests from the sales team. These requests, received daily, will contain data pertinent to the pricing for a customer's subscription, and the data presented should be checked for accuracy as well as for compliance with our product offerings for the entity type within their market. The analyst should have a keen eye for detail in assessing the request to ensure that the full scope of the subscription being offered is understood and accurately captured by information on which the analyst is being asked to price.
</li>
<li>Calculates pricing based on the established rate cards for the given market. Each member of the contracts team is expected to produce a pricing calculation consistent with the pricing set forth by our product marketing team. Understanding the nuances of pricing guidelines as they vary from market to market is essential to their accurate enforcement.
</li>
<li>Reviews and approves quotes up to a certain annual contract value. This process cross-checks the work of the fellow analyst, providing a second set of eyes in analyzing a contract request and associate price to hold them against our policies and approved offerings.
</li>
<li>Produce contracts based on the approved offering. This includes identifying the correct contract template to match the given request, as well as editing the template in order to match any specifications required beyond the standard form. The analyst crafts presentable customer-facing documents on a daily basis.
</li>
<li>Processes enterprise orders. The analyst is responsible for processing signed contracts to ensure that the system data corresponding to a customer's subscription order is in line with the details of their subscription agreement. Additionally, the analyst is responsible for providing the fully executed contract back to sales and advising our order entry team on any significant details pertinent to the order.
</li>
<li>Monitor the contract team's departmental email boxes. These email boxes have been established for receiving requests from other departments which flow outside the normal workflow for which our CRM is outfitted. They are a key point of communication between the contracts team and other departments such as sales and order entry. The analyst must consistently craft clear, efficient communication and respond within a certain time period. This includes providing status updates for requests not yet brought to their conclusion.
</li>
<li>Track requests that flow through the contracts team but require external assistance or input for resolution. At times it may be necessary to coordinate with other departments to respond comprehensively to a request fielded by the contracts team. The analyst should be able to effectively prioritize and be mindful of timelines in tracking and updating details on these requests.
</li>
<li>Document and archive deliverables in accordance with established standards and naming conventions. The contracts team fields contracts, invoices, tax exemption certificates, etc. and is responsible for delivering and storing them in consistent fashion so they can be easily retrieved as needed for various purposes. Occasionally, the analyst will be asked to assist with audits requiring quick delivery of such records.
</li>
