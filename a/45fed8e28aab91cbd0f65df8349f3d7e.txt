<h2>Software Architect</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Job Introduction
<br>We are looking for a hands-on software architect to join us at FLEETCOR as we build out our new in-house team to shape the future of the company.
<br><br>
As a senior member of the team, you'll help us grow our team, mentor teammates, and continuously help improve our practices and processes with a focus on secure, smart work.
<br><br>
Main Responsibilities
<br>Nature of Contribution
<br><br>
You won't be available for everyone all the time. One of the most significant contributions you can make for yourself, the team, and the company is documentation. It's one of several useful force multipliers you'll need to employ. You should be able to effectively document and diagram for audiences from executives to developers.
<br><br>
We expect you to promote coding standards and perform code reviews. You should be able to lead change; innovate, and challenge the status quo.
<br><br>
Leadership
<br><br>
Software architects provide more than technical leadership. Your ability to impact the organization is limited if you do everything. Mentoring and seeing other people progress, perhaps even surpass you, should be fulfilling.
<br><br>
You should also know how to rally the team. Jumping in to help shouldn't be a chore; it should be a chance to have some fun. Debugging an issue or lending a hand to code should be events that bring you closer to the team.
<br><br>
Successful leadership results in more leaders. You should be here for more than the code.
<br><br>
