<p><b>Job Description Summary:
</b></p>ICS - The Time to ACT is Now!
<br>
<br>
How about putting your foot into the door of the fastest growing business unit in J.B. Hunt? Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS), our Third Party Logistics &amp; Brokerage business segment, has grown exponentially since its inception in 2007. From 18 people and $42 million in revenue to over 1,000 people and $1 billion in revenue, we're not slowing down!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The three pillars of success for ICS are Accountability, Commitment, and Teamwork. We believe these three values distinguish us from our competitors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As a brokerage, ICS is very familiar with supply and demand. And as with any brokerage, for ICS, there is supply on one side and demand on the other, with the broker making money on the margin in the middle. For ICS, the supply side represents the shipments of freight of our customers. The demand side represents the 30,000+ partner transportation companies with whom we currently work. So, for example, consider a shipment of freight from Dallas, TX to Philadelphia, PA. Our customer has agreed to pay us $2,000 for the safe, on-time pick-up and delivery of the freight. So where would you come in?
