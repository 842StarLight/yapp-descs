<h2>Senior Front-End Engineer (Angular)</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>You will be working on a small team with an immense opportunity to make a difference. You will play a critical role in leading the front-end team in terms of best practice, clean code, peer code reviews, automated testing, and deployment. We are looking for a leader to help us accomplish our mission of changing the way users interact with their sales software.<p><b>
ABOUT US</b></p>
<p>
We're taking on the ambitious task of changing the way that sales teams interact with their sales software. Everyone has a virtual assistant on their smartphone, but those virtual assistants can't help sales teams close deals. Salespeople are spending too much valuable time sitting at a computer and entering sales data. We're changing that with our virtual assistant that manages data entry and provides intelligent assistance to sales teams; because honestly, you don't hire salespeople to enter data, you hire them to sell!</p>
<p>
We're an eager team looking to bring on some highly motivated engineers that will help us build out the future of sales software. We love building new things, we love breaking things, and we are always learning new things. Our team lives by the words of Steve Jobs, "Stay hungry, stay foolish."</p>
