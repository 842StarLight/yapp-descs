<h2>IT Sales Associate</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>Nine year old IT company based in Brooklyn is experiencing dramatic growth in the area of high-end enterprise hardware and software sales. We are looking for a Sales Associate who will play a key role in transforming the company from an ordinary reseller to a high-value trusted IT partner to our clients. You will be working with existing and new clients in the public sector while expanding our growth into the private sector.</p>
<p>The successful candidate is a self starter who requires little supervision and has the drive to expand their own role in the company. Daily duties will include seeking out advertised public sector opportunities, creating new public and private sector business (there will be a big focus on this), expanding our public client base outside of NY State, client relationship management and light marketing duties to complement the sales efforts (copy writing, social media engagement, brand promotion, etc)</p>
<p>Ideal candidate has an existing network of business contacts and enjoys the challenges of opening communication channels with top public and private sector IT decision makers. They will also have enough IT knowledge to interest these decision makers in speaking with our pre-sales engineers. As there will be meetings and conferences to attend, you must live in the NYC Tri-State area.</p>
<p>This is a 1099 role, with the possibility of converting to full time as well as building out the sales team as we continue to grow. Base fee + commission structure will depend on experience.
