<p><b>
You’ve come to the right place.</b></p>
<p>
At<b> Lovingly</b>, first and foremost, we’re all about people, culture, community, and relationships. (https://vimeo.com/224070)</p>
<p>
Our office is a home away from home. From going out to lunch, to taking walks on sunny days (even 29º ones), to happy hours at our local bar—we all <i>actually</i> enjoy spending time together.</p>
<p>
However, we don’t just hire people who mirror our culture. We hire people who <i>add</i> to it.</p>
<p>
Our success as a business comes from having an office full of laughter, led by strong, creative minds, and possibly people like you! (Having awesome products doesn’t hurt either!) (https://www.lovingly.com)</p>
<p><b>
Here’s what we do: </b>Most people get overwhelmed when they buy flowers online. We’ve created a guided gifting experience that makes it easy to send beautiful floral arrangements that celebrate life’s special moments. And we constantly strive to come up with newer, better, stronger ideas and products. We don’t just sit back and admire what has already been accomplished—we ask, “What can we do next?”</p>
<p><b>
Here’s why we do it: </b>We believe in the power of community. We believe that by helping one another each day and giving lovingly, we can strengthen relationships to help bring people closer together.</p>
<p><b>
Here’s why you should apply:</b> You have a strong work ethic and welcome challenges, and also enjoy being part of a company that works together as a team. You don’t give up when it seems like you’re facing a wall—you brainstorm, research, learn, and solve. You’re up for making a bunch of new friends (because we’ll be your friends whether you like it or not).</p>

<p><b>
Who You Are</b></p>
<p>
You are a storyteller at heart. You have a passion for the art and science of creating compelling and effective multimedia content. Whether shooting, editing, or producing, you understand the entire lifecycle of creating something meaningful. You also love working with audio and understand its role in elevating video or standing on its own to deliver a message.
</p>
<p>You know how to make your audience <i>feel</i> something. You have an eye for capturing what matters and removing the fluff that doesn’t add value.
</p>
<p>You handle pressure well and don’t get flustered easily as multiple high priority deadlines are competing for your attention. You are tenacious and resourceful. You are hyper-organized and have no problem pulling up “that video from 2 years ago that we used in that one campaign, remember?”</p>
<p><b>
Would you be a good fit?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re coming from the freelance life, you’ll love the focus and ability to hone in on a comprehensive content strategy. The opportunity to work on multimedia content all day makes your heart sing.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>What you’ll be doing</b></p>
<p><b>
Storytelling</b>. Your content is compelling because it tells a story. It creates an emotional connection with your audience and inspires them to take action.</p>
<p><b>
One-stop-shop. </b>You are excited to be a one-stop-shop: producer, shooter, editor and feel comfortable with graphics, visual effects, and audio production.</p>
<p><b>
Attention to Detail:</b> You notice and care about the little things, from color correction, audio balance, and fine tune cuts that make a difference in the final product.</p>
<p><b>
Balance.</b> You will be working on multiple campaigns with different audiences and channels at the same time. You know what to highlight for each to be a success and how to manage the project from beginning to end.</p>
<p><b>
Organize.</b> You will help create proper process and procedures for our video workflow including naming conventions, video archival and collection across multiple campaigns and channels.</p>
<p><b>
Analyze.</b> You are hungry to know what happens once your content is out there. You’ll dive into what’s resonating, what’s not, and then iterate to make the next piece of content even more engaging.</p>
