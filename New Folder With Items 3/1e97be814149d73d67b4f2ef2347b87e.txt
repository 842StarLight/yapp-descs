<p>Jennifer, one of Trilogy’s clients, nicely captured why we are proud to be who we are:</p>
<p>"The minute I walked through the doors, I knew there was something different and very special about this place. I only train there twice a week in a small group setting, but from the front desk staff who remember not only my name and other small details about my life to the owners who thank me by name for choosing their gym to all the trainers who go out of their way for fun banter and encouragement at the right time, my expectations have been blown away. I know that when I walk through the doors now, I'm not just walking into a gym/training facility, I'm walking into a community of people who truly care about the fitness, health, and well being of every member. Love, love, love this place!!!!"</p>
