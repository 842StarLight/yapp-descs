<p>ABOUT THE COMPANY</p>
<p>
We’ve been building businesses on Amazon for more than 10 years and we continue to be on the forefront as Amazon platforms evolve. We’re uncomfortable calling ourselves experts - since Amazon is always changing, we’re constantly adapting - but the breadth of our knowledge is vast and our team’s diverse experiences elevate our partners’ businesses. We’re marketers, advocates, data scientists, supply chain managers, Amazonians, advertisers, and merchants. But most importantly, we’re brand builders. Let’s build brands together.</p>
