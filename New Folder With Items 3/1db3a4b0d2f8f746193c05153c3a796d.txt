<b>Job Description:</b><br>
<p><b>COMPANY SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p>
At Intercept, our mission is to build a healthier tomorrow for patients with progressive non-viral liver diseases. Intercept’s lead product, Obeticholic Acid (OCA), is a first-in-class farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist. OCA, marketed under the brand name "Ocaliva®," is approved in the U.S., EU and Canada for certain patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a rare autoimmune liver disease. Ocaliva® was the first product to be approved for PBC in over twenty years and our team is proud to have been pioneers in providing the first second-line treatment option to patients with such critical need. The Ocaliva® launch in 2016 also marked Intercept’s successful transition from a development-stage company to a fully integrated commercial organization: thousands of patients across the globe have received access to Ocaliva® and sales continue to grow.
</p>
<p>In February 2019, Intercept reported positive topline results from the Phase 3 REGENERATE study of OCA in patients with liver fibrosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). REGENERATE is the first and largest Phase 3 study in NASH - a chronic disease that threatens the lives of millions of people in the U.S. alone. By 2020, NASH is expected to overtake hepatitis C as the leading cause of liver transplants in the U.S. Currently, there are no available treatments for NASH, and Intercept is among the leading companies focused on the disease.
</p>
<p>Based on the positive results from REGENERATE, Intercept intends to file for regulatory approval in the U.S. in the third quarter of this year, with a European filing following in the fourth quarter. This is an exciting time for Intercept, as the organization prepares for a potential approval and launch in NASH.
