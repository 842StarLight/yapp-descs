<p>
It is perhaps worth noting that while a CSA and the AE who cover the account operate in partnership for Frontier and the customer’s mutual benefit – there is an ongoing need for clear lines of accountability. The Frontier model is that the sales team is accountable for closing new sales and new business with a customer and ensuring accurate, timely clean orders are supplied to the COE teams. COE is accountable for accurately progressing those clean orders through to a successful first DPI invoice. From First bill review and throughout the remains of the customers support lifecycle the CSA is accountable for ensuring customer success and solving issues, problems and concerns as a customer advocate. Teamwork remains paramount but the partnership established across Frontier departments does not diminish or replace those lines of accountability.</p>
