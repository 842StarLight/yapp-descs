<p><b>Why Zuora?</b></p>
<p>
While systems play an important role in our growth and transformation, we believe that culture is far more important, and harder to build. To meet the needs of dynamic subscription businesses, we have built a dynamic company with innovation stamped into its DNA. At one of our first off-sites, we asked our employees: What do you want our culture to be? The question triggered an avalanche of stories, but the common thread was a sense of being in control of one’s destiny. It gave rise to the concept of the “ZEO.”</p>
<p>
At Zuora, we believe that every employee is the CEO of his or her Zuora career, i.e., a ZEO. This has fostered a culture centered around entrepreneurship, innovation, ownership, and responsibility. Zuora isn’t run by its CEO or executive team; it’s run by more than 1,300 passionate and innovative ZEOs, including our CEO. The result is a company of empowered and invested employees who bring out the best in one another.</p>
<p>
The <b>vision</b> we started off with stays true to this day: We believe that one day, every company will be part of the Subscription Economy.Our <b>mission</b> at Zuora is to enable all our customers to be successful in the Subscription Economy. It drives everything we do – our technology, our community, our knowledge, and our people. We’ve been doing this every day for the past decade and will continue to remain steadfastly focused on our customers.</p>
