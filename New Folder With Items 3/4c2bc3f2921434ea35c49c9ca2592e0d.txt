<p><b>Product Owner, Storage</b><br>
<b>Location:</b> Watertown, MA</p>
<p><b>
Why We Exist and What We Do:</b></p>
<p>
EditShare exists to simplify storytelling. We enable media professionals to collaborate on projects thanks to our ever-expanding range of innovative products and features, all designed to improve production and unleash creativity. Integration and collaboration are central to all products in our comprehensive range of media management solutions - from ingest to archive.</p>
<p><b>
Why We Need You:</b></p>
<p>
The product owner for EditShare’s Storage products will report to the Storage development manager and be responsible for our products’ backlog of features. You’ll collaborate with product management, sales, and technical support to prioritize features; you’ll work with product architects to elaborate features and with engineering management and scrum masters to plan delivery. Your success will be gauged by maintaining 2 (or more) sprints worth of prioritized backlog items ready for estimation and execution.</p>
<p><b>
Problems You’ll Solve:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Establish 2 sprints worth of prioritized features for 3 scrum teams –Watertown, Warsaw, and Vietnam. You will need to work closely between the development, product, and support teams to establish and prioritize the backlog. Some features will cross products. In this case, you will work with other product owners to introduce features cohesively or in usable phases.</li>
<li>Maintain consistent feature descriptions that contain descriptions of the feature, impact expected of delivery, user stories, and acceptance criteria. The information contained in the features will be used to guide implementation, build test cases, define customer documentation, and train support.</li>
<li>Work with the rest of the agile development team and provide approval for sprint plans and feature acceptance at demos.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What We’re Looking For:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>3+ years work experience as a Product Owner or similar role in an engineering organization.</li>
<li>Technical background with a mix of knowledge of software development, distributed software systems, UI/UX design, and media production.</li>
<li>Hands on experience with virtualized software environments (VMs and AWS EC2) and using the Ubuntu Linux operating system.</li>
<li>Superlative written and verbal communication skills – you’ll be working with teams for which English is not their native language and you’ll be doing a lot of technical writing.</li>
<li>Ability to understand software at the code level to understand code reviews and design discussions. Able to write scripts/programs to facilitate sprint reporting because we have a large and varied backlog and making sense of this data is critical.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How We Work:</b></p>
<p>
At EditShare, our culture is driven by a shared respect for our customers, our people and our products. We are passionate about our Core Values and believe they empower us to innovate and solve complex problems. We expect all employees to own culture and live by the values.</p>

<li>Dig Deep: We have the curiosity to ask questions until we understand and the integrity to follow through on hard discussions.</li>
<li>All Around Players: We are all willing and able to step in and play any position. We all own the problem and are willing to quarterback a solution.</li>
