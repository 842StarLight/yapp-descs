If you want to check out the technology, here is a cool video:<br>https://youtu.be/pWubGRLE1uw</p>
<p>We are looking for a solid Project Coordinator who can help manage our installs, collect the clients inventory, product photos, upload them on the CMS, etc. A lot of these tasks can be assigned to our teams in India to help manage. We use management tools like Jira (which is a Atlassian product) to manage our tasks and projects in India. We would be implementing this here in Vegas also to help organize these projects as we move forward.</p>
