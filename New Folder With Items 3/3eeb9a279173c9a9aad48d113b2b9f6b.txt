<h2>Marketing Director</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<h1 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>Company Background</b></h1>
<p>As consumers become increasingly mobile and connected, every business as part of its growth strategy is increasing investment in digital channels to acquire new customers more effectively. Of the $83 billion spent on digital this year, Google and Facebook account for 60 cents of every dollar. The amount spent by companies on digital customer acquisition has grown by 15.5% annually over the last 5 years while traditional advertising has remained flat. The result? Massive investment, overabundant data and rising expectations for better results.</p>
<p>Here is the problem. For every 6% in lead conversion success, 94% goes wasted because they are the wrong target profile, or never responded to. Companies are finding it increasingly difficult to target the right ads, cost-effectively, on the right digital channels to reach their most valuable customers, the profitable ones. As competition for customers continues to intensify, customer acquisition costs are rising, meaning companies are paying too much to place ads on the wrong channels, with the wrong messaging, coupled with poor conversion strategies, and it is negatively impacting these companies’ ability to hit customer acquisition and revenue growth goals.</p>
<div> <p>LQ Digital is a customer acquisition company with a simple goal:<br>
 To help brands win more profitable customers digitally.</p>
</div>
<p><b>LQ Digital</b> provides digital media services to acquire customers and contact center services to ensure faster conversion and delivery. We have proven success working in nearly all verticals except retail, with clients ranging from large enterprises (e.g. USAA, McAfee, The Home Depot, Penny Mac, HSBC, Outrigger Hotels, etc.) to high-growth “disrupter” B2C brands and startups (e.g. Uber, Getaround, SunBasket, Imperfect Produce, Postmates, Firstrade, etc) to run the entire end-to-end process of ‘manufacturing’ a new, a more profitable, customer.</p>
<p>What sets LQ apart for our customers and what makes us different: the company thinks more like “digital economists” than digital marketers. We leverage over twelve years of experience and benchmark data, customized KPIs/metrics and processes, obtained from having dedicated teams managing digital marketing strategies for large enterprises from lead generation through conversion.</p>
<p>Our approach is built around driving hard against unit economics and lifetime customer value (LTV) to maximize our client’s digital customer acquisition, revenue and profits, while minimizing marketing spend. The combination of our unique approach, experience, data, and in-house call center capabilities also allows us the ability to deliver our services in a pay-for-performance model which is atypical in our industry.</p>
<p>LQ generated $50M+ in revenue over the most recent fiscal year, and has been profitable for a decade. We are backed by private equity firm Housatonic Partners. LQ Digital is Headquartered in the East Bay, CA with offices in Austin, Texas, and Shelton, Connecticut.</p>
