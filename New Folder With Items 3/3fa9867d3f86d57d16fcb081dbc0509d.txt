<h2>Licensed Real Estate Inside Sales Agent</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>Is it really possible?</p>
<p>
40-Hour Week, REAL ESTATE CAREER Salary+Commission: Earn $60,000 and Up!</p>
<p>
For only two lucky licensed agents with experience, it is possible: an inside sales position, following up on and nurturing qualified leads (NO cold calls). Join a team of five other inside sales agents supporting one of the top sales teams in the area, work only a 40-hour week (2 weekends a month off), 1 week vacation, 7 paid holidays, 3 paid sick days and Insurance.<br>
</p>
<p>
NO open houses, NO buyer babysitting, TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONE after hours and relax and enjoy your life. Your free days are actually free!</p>
<p>
An exceptional opportunity to earn $60,000 to $90,000 a year, in the only stress-free real estate career.</p>
<p>
The agents who love this change and do well in this position have been successful, are knowledgeable, have good client management, communication and organization skills, and could continue earning a good living in regular real estate if they had to, but prefer a set number of hours, with their free time really, totally free. They can enjoy time with family or other interests and welcome the opportunity to focus on one sales function with pre-qualified leads, the freedom from endless cold prospecting, expensive advertising, intense competition and uncertain, unpredictable feast-famine Roller Coaster Income.</p>
<p>
If you have a quality track record, the necessary skills and are ready to come in out of the '80-hour a week, on-call-all-day-all-night-all-weekends rat race', we have a great place on our unique team for you.</p>
<p>
Your inquiry will be held in the strictest confidence. Your present broker/employer will not be contacted. (Note: the last time we advertised an opening, we were flooded with applicants and immediately filled the position. ACT NOW!)</p>
