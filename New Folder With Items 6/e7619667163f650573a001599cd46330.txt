<br>Why Qualtrics?
<br>--------------
<br><br>
Qualtrics is the technology platform that organizations use to collect, manage, and act on experience data, also called X-data™. The Qualtrics XM Platform™ is a system of action, used by teams, departments, and entire organizations to manage the four core experiences of business—customer, product, employee and brand—on one platform. Over 9,000 enterprises worldwide, including more than 75 percent of the Fortune 100 and 99 of the top 100 U.S. business schools, rely on Qualtrics to consistently build products that people love, create more loyal customers, develop a phenomenal employee culture, and build iconic brands. Qualtrics was recently acquired by SAP, and together we will accelerate XM and power the experience economy. Join us on this adventure that can open many doors!

<br>The Challenge
<br>-------------
<br><br>
As a Solutions Architect you will combine your business acumen and deep technical, hands-on experience to help large enterprises leverage the power of the Qualtrics platform and transform their business. In this role, you will work with business and technical decision makers from our largest accounts, as well as Qualtrics' technology partners and account teams.
<br><br>
Solutions Architects engage early in the project lifecycle where the customer is just beginning to define the vision, imagine what is possible and determine if it's feasible. The role requires an affinity for solution selling, technology evangelism and customer engagement. The ability to win the hearts and minds of our customers while explaining abstract technical concepts as they relate to business value, is a must.
<br><br>
---------------------------
<br>The Expectation for Success
<br>---------------------------
<br><br>
You will lead Project Discovery and Design Sessions as well as Project Scoping conversations in order to validate the customer solution and articulate the business impact of the solution.
<br><br>
You will accomplish this by designing technical solutions that meet customer's business objectives. This role requires a high degree of cross-functional collaboration with Sales, Engineering, and customers.
<br><br>
The position will provide technical expertise for scoping and defining solutions for customers with needs beyond the typical platform capabilities. It will also be an opportunity to influence the product roadmap by contributing to solutions utilized across multiple customer projects. This position will report directly to the Director of Solutions Architects.
