<p><b>Leads are a numbers game. Wait...say what?</b></p>
<p>That's right. Leads are a numbers game. For every 100 leads you receive, you should keep about 20, and net a minimum of 2-3 sales from those top 20. <i>Each</i> of those successful sales is worth 5 referrals down the road. You do the math! That's a lot of business. But it starts with being able to identify and focus on your serious buyers. They may not be ready to buy right away...but they will buy. These numbers are reflective of national sales trends. Close 20% of the top 20% (or 4% of total) and you'll have more success than you dreamed possible.</p>
<p><b>If you join us, you will have the following responsibilities: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Respond to most new leads within 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Contact unreached new leads a minimum of 7 times (we're hiring salespeople, not order takers)</li>
<li>Follow-up on your lead pipeline 2-3 hours per day, 4-5 days per week. (8-15 hours each week)</li>
<li>Update the CRM database after each attempt or with a summary after each contact</li>
<li>Learn the inventory - previewing and/or showing at least 2 days per week</li>
<li>Proactively work on improving your lead conversion and selling skills</li>
<li>Performance goals of a <i>minimum</i> of either 1-2 monthly pending sales or $250k average monthly closed volume after first 90 days</li>
</ul>
