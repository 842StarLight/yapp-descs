<h2>Customer Success Manager</h2>

<p>Ok, first things first: What does Weave do? Well, Weave created and continues to develop the most innovative communication platform for small businesses in the industry. It’s a phone system that also serves as a hub for everything a business needs to thrive in today’s competitive climate (think: two-way texting customers, text reminders, scheduling, online reviews...just to name a few).</p>
<p>
We’re able to provide brilliant software and customer service because we have incredible talent working at Weave. What’s more: 99% of our people recommend working at Weave to their friends… because we aren’t about that <i>employee</i> life. We’re about that <i>people</i> life. And the people of Weave are caring, creative, and hungry. (Let’s be clear- by hungry we mean they have the drive to exceed their highest potential. They’re not <i>actually</i> hungry- we have weekly team lunches and an entire cafe stocked with food to feed our small army.)</p>
<p>
So if you like hard work, autonomy and can handle seeing a grown man walking around in a disturbingly realistic (yet very cool) sloth mask apply here.</p>
