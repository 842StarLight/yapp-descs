The NICE inContact Enterprise Account Developer is responsible for generating new business opportunities and getting in touch with key stakeholders to set up discovery calls for our enterprise sales team. Enterprise Account Developers utilize professional sales skills to investigate prospective clients’ company structure, industry positioning, and any other relevant information. This information is used to penetrate the company by setting up a discovery call between the regional District Sales Manager (DSM) and the prospect with the intent of discovering a sales opportunity. They will hold a quota for the number of opportunities generated within their assigned territory and for the number of discovery calls set up within a given month. They will be assigned a mentor when they begin and once they have attained tenure in their position will be responsible for acting as a mentor for the new Enterprise Account Developers.<br>
