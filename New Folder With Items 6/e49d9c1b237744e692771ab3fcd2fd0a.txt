 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p><b>Summary/Objective</b></p>
<p>The primary role of the the Director of Sales (“DoES”) is to effectively manage and cultivate their assigned Enterprise Accounts based in the U.S. (“Enterprise Accounts”) identifying and closing new Opportunities, driving Add-Ons to current customers and building a sustainable recurring revenue model. It is incumbent upon the DoES to retire their quarterly and annualized Total Contact Value (TCV) Quota.</p>
<p><b>Essential Functions </b></p>
<p>Responsibilities and job dudes include the following. Other duties may be assigned.</p>
<p>1. You will deal with customers, partners, and urban-gro (UG) employees in an ethical, honest, courteous and professional manner</p>
<p>2. “Side deals” are strictly forbidden. A side deal is a verbal or written (e-mail, etc.) arrangement with a customer promising products or services which have not been documented in UG’s Service/Product Catalog, Master Agreement (MA) &amp; respective Order Form(s)</p>
<p>3. Vigorously work to retire quarterly and annualized TCV goals. This includes but not limited to independently prospecting, building a robust Pipeline (3X of your annualized TCV Quota) cultivating Enterprise Accounts, developing and closing TCV, identifying “On-ramps”, building a sustainable eco-system and identifying marketing levers that resonate with Enterprise Accounts, etc.</p>
<p>4. Timely response to customer Marketing Qualifed Leads (MQL’s), inquiries, phone calls and e-mails. These should be responded to as quickly as possible, with a maximum of 1 business day to respond</p>
<p>5. The DoES is expected to maintain a minimum of 50 percent Quota attainment for any trailing 120-day period (excluding initial 90-days after hire date)</p>
<p>6. Weekly update of Salesforce.com (SFDC), including all meetings and scheduled calls with customers, new prospects added, sales stages and status notes for all opportunities, forecasts and commitments. Failure to update SFDC on a weekly basis may result in forfeiture of commissions, bonuses and MBO’s</p>
<p>7. All Opportunities must follow the UG Selling System while maintaining full Sales Operation compliance to ensure efficiency and effectiveness with UG which will ultimately achieve customer satisfaction</p>
<p>8. Facilitate transition from a “Closed Won” opportunity to support and operations by working closely with the customer to ensure expectations are clear to the customer and UG. This includes involving the Account Manager (AM) within 48 hours of a “Closed Won”. This also requires taking diligent notes in SFDC to ensure a smooth transition to the support phase of our relationship with the customer</p>
<p>9. DoES’s are expected to meet the minimum requirements defined above, but the primary focus is Pipeline development and Quota attainment and retirement. It is ultimately the attainment of at least 80 percent of stated quarterly and annualized TCV Quota that must be met in order to be successful. If you are less than 50 percent of quota for any trailing 120-day period, you will potentially be given notice on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) with requirements to demonstrate improved performance going forward. Failure to meet these requirements may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, a reduction of pay, restrictions on leads/MQL’s received and possibly termination of your employment at UG.</p>
