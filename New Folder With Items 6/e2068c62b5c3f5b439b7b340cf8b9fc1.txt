<h2>Customer Success Associate</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">About Us
<br><br>
Centuria Foods is the largest and fastest growing hemp-based CBD manufacturer in the rapidly expanding CBD market. Prior to the 2018 Farm Bill passing (which legalized hemp across the US), we were the only fully federally compliant hemp CBD manufacturer in the U.S.
<br><br>
Consumer demand for high quality CBD, driven by those seeking a healthy, plant-based medicinal alternative to pharmaceuticals, is driving our growth. Centuria's management has been successful in building and selling companies from the medical cannabis and technology sectors. We are experiencing rapid growth and are looking for talented difference-makers that want to grow professionally quickly, make a discernible and strong impact, and challenge themselves beyond the usual 9-to-5 job in a merit-based culture.
<br><br>
