<ul>
<li>Expand Brady Background Checks to all gun sales. 1 in 5 guns are sold without a Brady Background Check due to gaps in the system that could be easily fixed.</li>
<li>
<p>Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Shooters in massacres such as Parkland, Las Vegas, Orlando, Sutherland Springs, Aurora, and Sandy Hook have all used assault weapons and high capacity magazines. These weapons of war DO NOT belong on our streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pass Extreme Risk Protection Order Laws (ERPO's) Nationwide. An extreme risk protection order allows family members and law enforcement to seek court permission to temporarily remove guns from a person in danger of harming themselves or others.</p>
