 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">About Us
<br><br>
Your Pie was founded in 2006 when founder Drew French visited his wife Natalie's family on the Italian island of Ischia. In Italy, everything centers around food and family. They cook on an open flame using brick ovens and high quality ingredients. Drew brought this idea back to his home in Athens, Georgia, where the Your Pie brand grew. Now with multiple stores spread throughout the Southeast and beyond, Your Pie is growing faster than ever. Our mission statement? To be a globally admired brand by creating a culture that improves the lives of the Your Pie family.
<br><br>
The menu at Your Pie focuses on custom, build-your-own options that are served fresh and fast. Guests can choose to build their own entrees from scratch, or choose from favorites that were created by Your Pie. Each location serves local, hand-picked craft beers to compliment the menu.
