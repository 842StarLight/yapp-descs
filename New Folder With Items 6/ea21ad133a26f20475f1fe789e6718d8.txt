<p>Sales Engineers play a major role in Duda's sales organization and are critical to deal success. Working side-by-side with sales, the SE is responsible for presenting the Duda product in the most relevant and best light to prospects and customers to invoke confidence in the technology and integration capabilities of the platform. Duda customers share common use cases, but rarely share the exact same implementation path or business needs. The SE will listen to the business needs of a prospect and map those to specific capabilities of the Duda platform. In doing so, the SE becomes a trusted technical advisor for the prospect during their evaluation phase of Duda and ensures they are on the best integration path.</p>
