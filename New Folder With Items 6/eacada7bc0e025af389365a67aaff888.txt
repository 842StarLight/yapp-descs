<p><b>We are looking for a Project Manager to join our Azusa, CA office!</b></p>
<p><b>Sunbelt Controls</b> is a leading full-service building automation contractor for new construction and retrofit projects in the Western United States. We provide complete, fully integrated, single-source solutions ranging from engineering applications and automated control systems to design assistance, sustainable maintenance service, retro-commissioning, and energy rebate supported projects.</p>
<p><b>At Sunbelt Controls, we strive to lead the industry with building control products and solutions that reduce energy and operational cost, which help our customers be more efficient and competitive in today’s world.</b> Just ask some of our recent customers: L.A. Live, Dupont, China Lake Naval Station, Boeing, UC San Francisco Hospital, and San Francisco 49ers Stadium. While we have been around for over 30 years, we continue to grow at a dynamic pace; our sales volume is forecasted to top $100 million by 2018.<br>
<br>
<b>Sunbelt Controls has valued project management as the key to implementing successful building automation systems.</b> Because we continue to grow, we have an opening for a Project Manager.
