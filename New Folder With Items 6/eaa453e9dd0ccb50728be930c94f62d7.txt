As a Senior Software Development Engineer on the Sponsored Products Allocation and Pricing team, you'd work with Product Managers, Economists and Applied Scientists to design and build mechanisms to optimize how the auction makes trade-offs between publisher, advertiser and shopper concerns. You’ll build technical solutions to solve complex business optimization problems. How do we get click and impression data into our systems in real-time to dynamically adapt which ads we show? How do we model and translate seemingly intangible concepts like relevance into economic terms? How do we solve the NP-complete problem of picking thousands of ads to slot in dozens of possible places on the page and do this billions of times a day within a few milliseconds?<br>

A successful candidate will be highly analytical and self-driven. They will be able to handle a high degree of ambiguity. They can identify problems, design and implement solutions and monitor and maintain them.</p>
