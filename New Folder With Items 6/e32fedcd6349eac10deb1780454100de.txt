<p>Life is too short to have a mediocre job with a mediocre company and you are too good for that.</p>
<p>
We are seeking a highly motivated, dedicated IT Technician to add to our growing staff. We are a 24-year old, technology services company with an extremely energetic, talented bunch of team members.</p>
<p><br>
We are based in Lockport, IL, but we have a rapidly expanding footprint in the downtown Chicago market. To help us with that expansion, we are looking for a technician that lives in downtown Chicago, near north side, or a very close suburb. Quick and easy access to Chicago will be a must. (Not all work will be in Chicago, so you still need a reliable vehicle for those occasional trips to the dreaded burbs)</p>
<p>
Here is what we are looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have to be a high-energy, go-getter. We don’t do laid back or lazy.</li>
<li>
Technology has to be your passion.</li>
<li>
You have to be a dedicated, hard worker.</li>
<li>
You need 5-7 years of general PC and Networking experience – at a company.</li>
<li>
A general, well-rounded technician with good debugging skills</li>
<li>
Good communication and good people skills.</li>
<li>
You are looking for a career, not a job. A place to call home.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is the straight scoop on us.</p>
<p>
We ask a lot of our people. We ask people to work long hours (often) and we expect results. We are a high-energy, highly motivated team. Some people thrive in this type of environment and some fail.</p>
<p>
If you are the type to thrive, then keep reading.</p>
<p>
You will be part of something here and will make a difference. You need to be passionate, dedicated and love technology.</p>
<p>
This is a field position…you will be out almost every day (Monday – Friday). You will drive (your vehicle), use public transportation, or sometimes Uber, a lot (locally) and will sometimes have 3-4 visits in a single day. If you like structure and well planned days, this isn’t for you. Things come fast and change fast.</p>
<p>
If you don’t like to be bored and like to be challenged, keep reading. No two days are ever alike.</p>
<p>
If we haven’t scared you off yet – you might be a good fit for us. Now, even with all that said, this really is a great place to work. Good people, good customers…great team. We are fun but we do work hard….you really can have both.</p>
<p>
OK – here are the boring details that you would expect to see for this type of job posting.</p>
<p><br>
The ideal candidate will have 5-7 years experience installing, maintaining and troubleshooting PCs, networks and servers. Hands-on experience setting up PCs and networks is a must.</p>

<ul>
<li>

<li>
Malware cleanup</li>
<li>

<li>
Commitment to excellence in customer service and the ability to work in a team environment.</li>
