<p>_“During the summer of 2019, I interned for Catalyst Media as a Lead Development Representative. My daily responsibilities included bringing value to companies by providing benefits to their clientele. Overall, I am proud to have worked there. I worked inside an office that surrounded me with supportive staff and team members. The job experience enhanced many of my skills such as interpersonal communication, resilience, listening and my problem-solving capabilities. When the summer was over my former boss allowed me to continue working for the company with hours that fit around my class schedule. They worked with me; how could you ask for anything more?<br><b>Jessica, Thomas Jefferson University</b>_</p>
