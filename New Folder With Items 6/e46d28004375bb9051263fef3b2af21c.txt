<div>
<div>VTS is changing the way that commercial real estate (CRE) is done - disrupting a $15 trillion dollar industry by becoming the modern operating system for CRE. We invented the category of leasing and asset management, which allows landlords and brokers to manage their entire leasing process to maximize revenue and performance. Our success shows in our numbers - we’ve grown 123% annually since 2013, and today we have over 10 billion square feet of commercial space managed on VTS, and we’ve expanded to ~200 employees globally. It’s an exciting time to join the VTS team as we continue to scale!</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
Our headquarters are in NYC, but we have hubs in other major US cities, Toronto, CA and London, UK.

ABOUT THE NEW VTS MARKETPLACE</b></div>
<div>
Over 60% of the US class A office space is already managed using the VTS leasing platform, and it is by far the #1 choice of commercial landlords in the US. The VTS marketplace will integrate with the VTS leasing platform and will be the commercial real estate industry’s first marketplace where tenants can search as well as transact leases online, and landlords can automate their advertising and lease execution—all from within the VTS leasing platform.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
The VTS marketplace will attract and engage tenants for the available spaces of VTS customers. Unlike existing listing sites, the VTS marketplace will enable both landlords and brokers to dramatically improve the marketing and leasing of spaces by automating both the listing and leasing process and will provide tenants with the most accurate and thorough listings in US top markets.
