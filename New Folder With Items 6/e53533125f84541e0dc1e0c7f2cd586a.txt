<p><b>About PaintCare</b></p>
<p>PaintCare, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, was established by the American Coatings Association (ACA) to implement state-mandated paint stewardship programs on behalf of paint manufacturers in each state that adopts a paint stewardship law. Funding for PaintCare is provided through a fee on new paint sales. Funding is used to support drop-off sites where the public can take leftover paint for recycling, pay for the recycling of this paint, and provide public education and program administration. Oregon passed the first industry-supported paint stewardship law in 2009. PaintCare states now include California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Maine, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont, with a program currently under development in Washington. Please visit <b>www.paintcare.org</b> (http://www.paintcare.org) for more information.
</p>
<p>PaintCare's headquarters is located in Washington, DC. Corporate staff members are located at the DC office, while most program staff are located in the states with paint stewardship programs. This position is located at the Washington, DC office.</p>
