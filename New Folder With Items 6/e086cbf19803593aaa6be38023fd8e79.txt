<div><b>Q&amp;A WITH ARMANINO TAX PARTNER, JOHN BRYCHEL</b></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>
On August 1, 2017, I had the following discussion with John Brychel about Armanino Tax and the opportunity you are interested in.</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><b>
What is Armanino’s culture like in the San Ramon office?</b></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
“We’re a very family-oriented office, meaning both that we provide flexibility with work schedules and that it also feels like we’re a family. We are all moving towards the same goals and understand that we’re on the same team. It’s very much a one-firm concept.</i></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
Our people work hard and are well rewarded, they can stand out on their own merits and accomplishments which is very unique.”<br>
</i></div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Why is this a good opportunity for a Tax Manager/Senior Manager coming from the Big 4 or a regional firm?</b></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
“We’re so well positioned in the market place where we can scale up or down. Armanino represents a great alternative to the Big 4 for both our clients and our people - we have the same resources and the ability to create growth which leads to more opportunities. A big difference between us and the Big 4 is that no one gets lost in the shuffle here; like I mentioned before, everyone can stand out on their own merits and accomplishments.</i></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
Another reason why this is such a great opportunity is that you can create your own career path, whether it’s an existing path or something different, we’re willing to make investments and do creative things.<br>
</i></div>
<div></div>
<div><i>Ultimately it comes down to the fact that we have so much opportunity and potential to offer. The sky is the limit.”</i></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><b>
What will this person’s future look like at Armanino and what are a few of the most important intangibles they need to have, in order to be successful in this position?</b></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
“This person’s career is in their owns hands and the opportunity is here for the taking, nobody is going to hold them back. There is a lot of resources and support to help somebody get to where they want to be.</i></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
The most important intangible I’m looking for is a thinker. We always need people that do, but we also want people that think. As you get higher up in your career there isn’t a roadmap - you’re expected to be resourceful and think things through. While doing the job well and right is important, looking back at the big picture will help you get there.</i></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
To be successful you must also be a strong mentor to not only build up those around you, but to create your own internal network of people that will go the extra mile for you.<br>
</i></div>
<div></div>
<div><b>WHY A TAX PARTNER CHOSE ARMANINO</b></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
“I joined Armanino as an intern with my time being split between IT and Tax. I was one hundred percent IT for 2 years then decided that I wanted to get back into tax and thankfully I was able to make the switch.</i></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
I did leave the firm for a brief stint in industry, but ultimately found my way back. Besides my new role not being exactly what I wanted, it was the people that I really missed. We have a great group of people here, people that I really look up to. I also saw the potential I had at Armanino with all the growth we were (and still are) experiencing.</i></div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><i>
I’ve been here ever since and never once regretted coming back.”</i></div>
</div></div></div>
