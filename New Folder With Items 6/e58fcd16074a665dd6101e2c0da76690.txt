<h2>Sr. Scientist - NGS Assay Development</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<div>
<p>The Sequenom division of LabCorp, focused on women's healthcare tests and non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has an exciting opportunity for a Senior Scientist to join its R&amp;D Diagnostics Development Team! In conjunction with the Marketing and Sales teams, the Senior Scientist will conceive of new &amp; innovative diagnostic testing opportunities. The selected candidate will plan and execute proof of concept experiments, evaluate assay potential relative to current commercial options and assess the time and resources required for biochemistry development. Along with other team members, he/she will plan and execute experiments, critically analyze the data and interpret the results. The ideal candidate will have extensive knowledge of molecular biology and biochemistry as well as a proven track record in development of novel nucleic acid detection assays. Experience with the analysis of genomic data, in particular NGS and/or microarray data, is preferred. Understanding of the fundamentals of sampling statistics and low frequency variant detection is a plus. This is an exciting opportunity to be part of a dynamic R&amp;D team and have the opportunity to participate in novel technology development.</p>
