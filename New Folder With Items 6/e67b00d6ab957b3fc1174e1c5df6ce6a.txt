<br><br>
Riaz Capital is a fully integrated development, construction and property management company, focused on addressing the changing housing needs of the millennial generation. With a unique appreciation for design and architecture, we find properties in desirable locations and rehabilitate existing buildings as well as develop new properties to create stylish, desirable homes that meet the needs of today’s Bay Area workforce, while bringing value to the communities around them. Our integrated group of companies across development, construction, and property management delivers efficiency and long-term thinking to all of our projects while allowing us to create above-market returns for our investors.
<br><br>
The Riaz Capital team includes over 95 talented real estate investment, construction and operations professionals across its offices in San Francisco and Oakland. Our Principals have been successfully operating in the Bay Area since 1977. The Company currently owns and operates ~1,300 units, with $300 Million of assets under management (AUM). Riaz Capital has maintained consistent growth over the last 5+ years, and after the completion of three development projects currently in process, that number will increase to ~$400 Million AUM by 2019 and looking to grow to ~$1BN in assets under management by 2025.
<br><br>
Our latest projects are aimed at creating affordable and conveniently located housing for young professionals in the East Bay. The Bay Area's tremendous growth has resulted in skyrocketing housing costs forcing young professionals to make hard choices about privacy and savings to find a reasonable housing option to call home. On average, Bay Area millennials are spending 48% of their income on housing verses a national average of 25%. We are seeking highly motivated, forward thinking professionals to join our team in solving this important housing problem to provide comfortable, cool and reasonably priced housing for the "missing middle."
