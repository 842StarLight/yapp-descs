Finance Development TRACK Program:</i></b></div>

This program is comprised of select employees that recently attained a bachelor’s degree in finance, accounting or a related business field without full-time relevant prior work experience.

Upon completion of the program, bachelor degree candidates are expected to progress to either a broad managerial development path or to a specific business area developmental path.</div>
<div>
Rotations typically consist of at least one (1) project requiring advanced data gathering, analytical capability, and presentation skills. Each project gives an opportunity to propose and implement business solutions with regional and/or global footprints. Analysts are expected to consult with GM’s globally diverse organizations to gather data, perform analyses, and present recommendations to senior GM executives. The positions are primarily in SE Michigan, but can also include a plant across the country and, in later rotations, possibly overseas in business units or regional treasury centers. There are three primary paths to choose within GM Finance, including Operations, Treasury, and Accounting roles.</div>
