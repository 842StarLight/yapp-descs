The Search Experience team takes an incredibly complicated home search process and brings it online into an addictive, empowering, and delightful map-based experience. The map is the core of Redfin’s search experience: our users love it and tell us time and time again that it helps them in their home searching journey. The team owns user experience that shows data about hundreds of homes in a performant way, and creates search APIs that are used by all of Redfin Engineering. We want to go further—drive user growth via word of mouth, SEO, and SEM; improve performance; find ways to differentiate and personalize our home search experience in ways no other real estate site can, and much more.</div>
