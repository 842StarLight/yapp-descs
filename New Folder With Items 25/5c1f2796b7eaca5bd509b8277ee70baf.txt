<div><b>Problem</b></div>
<div>
In the $12T construction industry, 98% of projects are delivered, on average, 80% over budget. Doxel is on a mission to stop that from happening.
</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>Root cause? Inability to measure site progress in an objective, trustworthy and frequent manner. Construction managers are frequently surprised to discover that their multi-million dollar projects have been running behind for several weeks or months. By that point, the money has already been spent and it’s too late to fix the problem.
</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><b>Solution</b></div>
<div>
Doxel uses robots to survey sites every day, proprietary deep learning and AI based algorithms to assess progress and turns the terabytes of data it collects into simple insights for project managers that enable them to react to issues in minutes, not months. This enables them to constantly correct site inefficiencies and has demonstrated RoI of eliminating overages entirely and even delivering projects up to 11% below budget.
</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>Doxel has taken the market by storm since it’s launch last year - closing deals with marquee customers such as Kaiser Permanente, Sutter Health and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.
</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div><b>Team</b></div>

Doxel’s team consists of some of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley that include PhDs, engineers, business leaders and civil engineering professionals on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, graduates from Stanford University and with experience at organizations such as Google Advanced Technologies &amp; Projects.
</div>
