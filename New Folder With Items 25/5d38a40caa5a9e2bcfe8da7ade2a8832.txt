<p><b>
Performance Objectives:</b></p>
<p>
The following reflects management�s definition of essential functions for this job but does not restrict the tasks that may be assigned.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Analysts are intimately involved in and support all phases of a contract, from proposal preparation through contract closeout. Financial Analysts are Management�s resource to assist with the process of making sound business decisions. As a result, ad hoc analysis may be required. In addition to participating in the bid process, Analysts assist Program Management &amp; Project Engineering in establishing the cost accounts and earned value criteria for the program. Analysts must understand the requirements of their internal customers and provide useful, timely data to assist in the decision-making process.</li>
<li>
Analysts are forward thinking and proactive, anticipate the needs of Management, challenge the status quo when appropriate, and keep the best interests of L-3 Communications at the center of their conclusions. As primary process owners of the EAC financial reporting cycle, analysts are required to adhere to L-3 Communications Sarbanes-Oxley Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFRs) for applicable cycles (EAC, Revenue, etc) as well as L-3 Communications Corporate Accounting Policy No. 301.</li>
<li>
Analysts provide the financial analysis which forms the backbone of the division�s regular Program Reviews given by Program Management. This analysis of program status includes Actuals, ETC, EAC and Earned Value (where applicable) based on inputs from the program team. Analysts are integral members of the program team and are expected to be the subject matter expert regarding financial performance (including Actuals and ETCs) of their programs. Their expertise, unique perspective, and unbiased analysis should provide Management with an early warning of potential performance issues, identify potential risks, and quantify upsides.
</li>
<li>In situations where a contract calls for regular customer reporting (such as those defined in CDRLs), the Analyst prepares mathematically correct reports for submission to the customer by Contracts/Program Management not later than the agreed-upon due date.
</li>
<li>Analysts maintain current, accurate and complete files which support the financial baselines being reported, including the Quad Chart content. Analysts ensure that actual cost reported agree to the General Ledger and that all estimates provided by other functional organizations are properly supported.
</li>
<li>A successful Analyst is able to maintain composure and a professional approach when dealing with internal and external customers, focus on details with regard to procedure and workflow, think rationally and make decisions logically, and work under pressure and against tight deadlines. This role carries independent decision making authority. The impact of an error in judgment could result in misreporting significant financial data and/or inaccurate recording of contract performance/status, which could result in erroneous decisions and adverse financial performance.</li>
<li>
The department manager will look to the Senior Analyst�s leadership and experience to lead special projects within the Program Finance group. The Senior Analysts will provide the leadership and experience to help make the best decisions for the group.
