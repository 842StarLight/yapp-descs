<h2>Life Insurance Agent: 115% Commission +$7 Lead</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>We are looking for Agents interested in earning a good living at a fair commission level. After all, you are the one who is running appointments, making the sales and paying for the leads.</p>
<p>We donâ€™t promise you $100k per year, like every other ad on Craigslist. If they promise you that you can make that kind of money starting at a commission level of 55 or 85 or even 100% while paying their $25 to $40 lead costs, imagine what you could do with us, at <b>115% and $7 lead costs</b>.</p>
<p>Imagine if you had 20 leads and sold just 3 policies at $55 each (national average). You would earn almost $89,000 per year. Now if you can sell more, you will earn more.</p>
