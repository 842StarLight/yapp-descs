<h2>Sr/Director Analyst Relations</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Zuora is seeking a senior strategic Industry Analyst Relations leader to join an amazing team of global ZEOs to build a world-class AR function on top of a very strong foundation. For the last 100 years, companies have operated primarily under a product-centric business model, where the goal was to make, ship, and sell more units. Today, there's a demand to have products and services delivered on a continual, subscription basis; to upgrade and access new innovations and features constantly. This is the end of ownership and it changes everything. Our vision is "The World Subscribed" where one day every company will be a part of the Subscription Economy® (a phrase coined by our CEO, Tien Tzuo).
<br><br>
Zuora provides cloud-based software on a subscription basis that enables any company in any industry to successfully launch, manage, and transform into a subscription business. Our growth story is only just beginning. Zuora has been named a leader in Forrester's most recent Wave on Recurring Customer and Billing Management, IDC's MarketScape on Subscription Relationship Management and a visionary in Gartner's most recent Magic Quadrant on CPQ solutions.
<br><br>
This is a key, strategic cross-functional role that will work with a variety of experts at all levels of the business. Reporting into the VP of global brand and communications, you'll engage regularly with product management, product marketing, finance, global services, engineering, sales and marketing teams. You'll leverage your experience to build lasting, credible relationships with top-tier and specialized analyst firms based on a demonstrated command of product and technical knowledge. If you understand financial operations, have a knack for competitive positioning, want to help forge a new category of enterprise software with an industry innovator and leader with the whole company's support behind you, then this position is for you.
