At Arm, we are guided by our core beliefs that reflect our rare culture and guide our decisions, defining how we work together to defy ordinary and shape extraordinary:</p>
<p><b>
We not I</b></p>
<p>
Take daily responsibility to make the Global Arm community thrive.<br>
No individual owns the right answer. Brilliance is collective.<br>
Information is crucial, share it.<br>
Realise that we win when we collaborate — and that everyone misses out when we don’t.</p>
<p><b>
Passion for progress</b></p>
<p>
Our differences are our strength. Widen and mix up your network of connections.<br>
Difficult things can take unexpected directions. Stick with it.<br>
Make feedback positive and expansive, not negative and narrow.<br>
The essence of progress is that it can’t stop. Grow with it and own your own progress.</p>
<p><b>
Be your brilliant self</b></p>
<p>
Be quirky not egocentric.<br>
Recognise the power in saying ‘I don’t know’.<br>
Make trust our default position.<br>
Hold strong opinions lightly.</p>
