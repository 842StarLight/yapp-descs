<br><br>
At Segment, we believe companies should be able to send their data wherever they want, whenever they want, with no fuss. We make this easy with a single platform that collects, stores, filters, transforms, and sends data to hundreds of business tools with the flip of a switch. More recently, we also developed the ability to let customers enrich their data in real time using computations they specify. Our goal is to make it easy to understand, extract value, and protect the integrity of data. We are creating a world where engineers spend their time working on their core product, letting us take care of the complexities of processing their customer data reliably at scale. We're in the running to take over the entire customer data ecosystem, and we need the best people to take the market.
<br><br>
The Enterprise Customer Success team at Segment is the central touchpoint for our Enterprise customers, orchestrating the post-sales customer lifecycle in partnership with Solutions Architects, sales and support. The team manages the customer relationship, coordinates internally within Segment, drives product adoption and guides the customer to take full advantage of our ecosystem. Fundamentally, Customer Success Managers ensure customers derive value from our platform, and ultimately renew and grow their relationship with us.
<br><br>
We are looking for Sr. CSMs who are passionate about customers and the ways in which they use data to drive results. As a Sr. CSM, you will have the opportunity to help some of the world's most influential companies solve their toughest data problems. So if you get excited about things like defining culture and process, you may be the Customer Success Manager we're looking for!
