<p></p>
<p>Broadcom Inc. is a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of
<br>
digital and analog semiconductor connectivity solutions. Broadcom’s extensive product
<br>
portfolio serves four primary end markets: wired infrastructure, wireless
<br>
communications, enterprise storage and industrial &amp; other. Applications for our products
<br>
in these end markets include: data center networking, home connectivity, set-top box,
<br>
broadband access, telecommunications equipment, smartphones and base stations,
<br>
data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative
<br>
energy systems, and electronic displays. For more information, go to

The build-out of 5G networks will require an increase in capacity of the mobile network
<br>
by a factor of ten or more and a simultaneous tightening of key synchronization
<br>
requirements. While Ethernet technology is very high capacity, it has not met the strict
<br>
synchronization and jitter requirements of cellular networks in the past. IEEE’s new
<br>
802.1CM (Time-Sensitive Networking for Fronthaul) standard provides a
<br>
synchronization solution that solves this problem and the cellular network can now be
<br>
upgraded to an end-to-end Ethernet-based architecture that meets the cost, capacity,
<br>
and performance requirements of 5G.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
As an experienced Timing Software Applications Engineer you’ll act as a technical lead
<br>
working with customers to build the next generation Ethernet-based Network
<br>
architectures using Broadcom’s cutting edge StrataXGS and StrataDNX Ethernet
