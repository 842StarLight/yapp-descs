<p>For evaluating the quality of candidates for referral to the selecting official, a three-phased process will be used. This phasing will be used in conjunction with HireMe for greater Subject Matter Expert (SME) input in evaluating the quality of candidates.<br>
<br>
<b>Phase 1:</b> Applicant resumes will be reviewed by Human Resources to ensure they meet the basic qualification requirements (see Definition of Specialized Experience). If applicants meet basic qualifications and score at least 90 on the initial phase, they will continue on to the second phase and will be given an interim score based on the applicant assessment questionnaire, which will take the applicant approximately 30 minutes to complete when initially applying.<br>

Applicants must make a fair and accurate assessment of their qualifications. If a determination is made that you have rated yourself higher than is apparent in your description of experience, competencies, skills, and/or education/training OR that your resume/application is incomplete, you may be rated ineligible or your score may be lowered.<br>
<br>
<b>Phase 2:</b> All candidates who pass the first phase will be contacted via email and asked to submit narrative responses, within one week, which will address the competencies listed below. Subject Matter Expert(s) will review the score and narrative responses:<br>
