<h2>Visual Designer</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">You're looking for an adventure where you can tackle complex problems, drive change, and help establish a powerful and novel product.

You're comfortable with being uncomfortable, and you thrive in an environment based on continual improvement. You aren't afraid to try new things and make mistakes. If this sounds like you, we want you on our team!

We're looking for a Visual Designer with 2 or more years of multi-disciplinary design experience.
