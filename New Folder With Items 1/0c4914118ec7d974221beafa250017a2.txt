<div><div><div>
<p>The Code Compliance section of the Department of Construction and Inspections improves the safety and quality of life of the people of the City of Seattle. We do this by inspecting rental housing and properties in residential neighborhoods and commercial districts, and enforcing city codes governing housing conditions, vacant and deteriorated buildings, and use of land.<br>
<br>
We have an opportunity to add a dedicated Senior Housing Zoning/Compliance Inspector to our staff to support the Rental Registration and Inspection (RRIO) program. The RRIO program helps ensure that all rental housing in Seattle is safe and meets basic housing maintenance requirements found in the City's Housing and Building Maintenance Code (HBMC). The RRIO program requires rental properties to register with the city and be inspected at least once every ten years. The Senior Inspector plays a key role in our efforts to help ensure that housing is safe and livable, activities in changing neighborhoods continue to comply with code standards and our beautiful city is maintained for the benefit of all.<br>
<br>
As a Senior Inspector:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will serve as the department technical expert on the Rental Registration and Inspection Ordinance (RRIO) checklist and inspection process, working with both internal and private inspectors.
</li>
<li>You will provide technical assistance and training to property owners, private inspectors, department staff, and the general public, including presentations at public workshops; assist in code interpretation and difficult cases; support the supervisor and managers in day-to-day operations.
</li>
<li>You will coordinate and provide follow-up inspections on the more difficult, complex, or politically sensitive RRIO and other code enforcement complaints, and consult and share information on such cases with management.
</li>
<li>You will explore technological and process improvements to enhance work of the RRIO and other code compliance programs and support continuous quality improvement.
</li>
<li>You will perform comprehensive inspections related to RRIO, abatement, demolition, condominium conversion and pre-sale inspection programs, and prepare appraisals of properties and structures and cost estimates for repair and demolition recommendations using estimator and appraisal tools and drawing and diagramming software.
</li>
<li>You will prepare case files to present property conditions for administrative review and provide testimony at administrative hearings in support of unfit building abatement.
</li>
<li>You will develop, award, and monitor contracts for building demolitions and property cleanup, and arrange work plans and oversee City crews in court-ordered premises abatements.
</li>
<li>You will investigate complaints and issue notices regarding violations of the RRIO, Land Use, Housing and Building Maintenance, Weeds and Vegetation Codes.
</li>
<li>You will write administrative reviews for the RRIO program and variance decisions for HBMC variance requests.
</li>
<li>You will support the workgroup supervisors in the day-to-day operations of the workgroup including case assignments and filling in as needed when other staff is unavailable or needs support in the field.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Your work will also encompass the full range of duties of a journey-level compliance inspector, including investigating complaints and issuing notices regarding violations of the Land Use, Housing and Building Maintenance, Weeds and Vegetation, Tree Protection, and Shoreline Codes; resolving some violations cooperatively and others by escalating enforcement with fines and sometimes with legal action; keeping careful records so that your coworkers and the public have accurate and thorough information about your cases and so that your casework can effectively support legal action; and developing relationships within coworkers and with people in other agencies who will help you do your job and accomplish the City's goals.<p></p>
