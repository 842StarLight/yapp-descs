DESCRIPTION:<br>
The Merchandise Planner serves as the business manager for a book of business (collection of sub-brands or classes of merchandise) and is primarily responsible for translating the Merchants' vision into viable plans and profitable results. The Merchandise Planner is responsible for developing and maintaining sales, inventory, and margin plans that tie to financial targets for an assigned Sub-Brand/Category. Plans will begin at the Sub-Brand/Category level and will drive to choice-level (Style/Color or Fragrance) plans, creating targeted assortments by cluster (group of stores with similar selling characteristics). In partnership with the Merchant, the Planner drives to additional value through optimizing the assortment for these clusters, which may include multiple channels of distribution (Stores, Internet, Catalogue, and Wholesale). In collaboration with the Demand/Event Planner, the Merchandise Planner generates demand plans that incorporate statistically-based forecasts, merchandise plans and business knowledge. Demand plans provide the basis for future merchandise plans, as well as a forward-looking expectation of sales to inform the distribution process.<br>
