<h2>Director of Technical Solutions (DC)</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">At Ad Hoc we build government digital services that are fast, efficient, and usable by everyone
<br><br>
Ad Hoc brings small teams of highly skilled professionals from the private sector to build government software right the first time.
<br><br>
Solving government technology problems is about attacking big problems with design, engineering, and compassion. We're committed to continually improving what we build and staying focused on user needs for the long haul.
<br><br>
As Director of Technical Solutions at Ad Hoc, you'll be a key member of our team and will contribute directly to our goal of cultivating new customer relationships. You will be responsible for creating and articulating technical solutions to business problems, working closely with both internal teams and our customers.
<br><br>
You have a deep background in web application architecture and development, with a focus on consumer-facing digital services that provide a great user experience. You have a deep understanding of not only the technology behind these applications, but the process by which they evolve from concept to development, and how they operate in production. You are comfortable with multiple open source programming languages like Ruby, Java, JavaScript, and Go, and know which one to use for a particular application. You have deployed services in cloud environments like Amazon Web Services, and are fluent in the basic services they provide such as EC2, S3, and RDS, and can quickly learn, understand, and effectively use new services. You've built APIs for services and understand the best way to employ an API as part of a solution to a business problem. You can evaluate a business problem and make a buy vs. build decision to meet some or all of the requirements. With this background, when presented with a business problem, you can clearly articulate a solution that combines SaaS and COTS products with custom software to guide a customer to success.
<br><br>
You understand the government technology market, and have a passion for addressing the challenges government agencies face in delivering digital services and technology. You embrace change, a dynamic remote work environment, and thrive in developing technical solutions and methodologies that are simple, efficient, and effective, and align with our mission to empower government customers to deliver superior digital services.
