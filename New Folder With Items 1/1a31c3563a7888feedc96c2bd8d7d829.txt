<h2>Product Marketing Manager (Infura)</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">ConsenSys is a venture production studio and the leading technology firm in blockchain globally. We deliver products, solutions and platforms built using blockchain technology to transform how business is done in complex network of buyers, suppliers and consumers.
<br><br>
Our teams are busy at work building the future of identity, financial markets, commerce, the music industry, security, and infrastructure, and more. To accomplish this we've built out a flat organizational structure which we call the ConsenSys Mesh: a network of individuals &amp; teams working autonomously and towards the same goal. Our mission is to use these decentralized solutions to fundamentally reshape the economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us.

<b>About Infura at ConsenSys:</b><br>
Infura is an infrastructure company providing scalable and easy to use APIs and cloud solutions for Web3 developers. Infura currently supports Ethereum and IPFS APIs, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting their own infrastructure.
<br><br>
Infura provides developers instant access to Web3 without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.
<br><br>
We believe in a decentralized future powered by Web3, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.
