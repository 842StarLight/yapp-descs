<p>Increasingly, our customers want knowledge about the products they purchase: that they were produced responsibly, and that the people in our supply chains, fulfillment centers, and transportation networks were treated fairly. Amazon’s Social Responsibility Technology Team applies Amazon’s technical breadth and depth to solve this problem. Our team builds software that gives a voice to our workers – from area managers in our fulfillment centers, to software developers in our South Lake Union headquarters, to the workers in our supply chain producing the Amazon brands for sale on Amazon.com. We’re reinventing Social Responsibility at Amazon scale, and it’s still day one!<br>
<br>
As a Software Engineer on the Transparency and Trust team, you’ll architect software that ensures the people in our supply chains, fulfillment centers, and transportation networks are treated fairly, as well as making Amazon’s sustainability decisions more transparent to our customers. You’ll build novel solutions that give Amazon insight into our supply chain through a uniquely altruistic lens. You'll invent novel ways of collecting, analyzing and enabling discovery of supplier data from a variety of real-time sources. You'll innovate and influence the direction of the latest Amazon technologies. And, with Amazon’s breadth, your work will transform how Social Responsibility is approached at Amazon, and in turn influence the entire industry.<br>
<br>
A successful candidate will thrive in and help lead fast-paced environments that leverage agile planning techniques, encourage and reward creative design and intelligent risk taking, and find innovative ways to leverage cutting edge technology. And of course, a demonstrated passion for sustainability doesn’t hurt!</p>
