<div>
<div>As a leading worldwide provider of navigation devices and wearable technology, our focus is on developing, designing, repair, refurbish and supporting superior products. Our advanced technology promotes performance, safety and ease of use in every market we serve. That makes us an engineering and technology company with a keen focus on recruiting talent in those fields. But the same vertical integration business model that keeps all design and manufacturing processes in-house also gives us the incentive to hire top performers from different backgrounds, including operations, finance and accounting, information technology, sales, marketing and communications.</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>
In operations and facilities, we literally do it all…in-house. We are looking for skilled, energetic individuals who want to join our quality, international shipping, manufacturing, office services, planning, purchasing, receiving, returns and warehouse teams. These associates do everything from delivering packages and purchasing supplies to assembling aviation panel mounts and ensuring our large shipments of goods are exported according to applicable international laws. Together, they proactively support associates and customers alike. If you’re ready to work – and have fun, too – come, help us put the pieces together!</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>
The secret to success is in the process, at least for these engineers. Our process engineers not only improve production and repair methods – layout, lean production flow, tooling/product equipment, material, fabrication, etc. – they also determine space requirements to ensure efficiency in manufacturing and repair processes in the industrial plant. Their ultimate goal: to continually improve products, processes and personnel. Our process engineer position is open on the following team:</div>
<ul><li><div>Board Assembly – production of printed circuit boards for all aviation products</div></li></ul>
<div>If you are ready to implement processes to keep us ahead of the competition, we’re ready for you to come on board.</div>
