<br>The Challenge
<br>-------------
<br><br>
Our Customer Success Managers work proactively with customers who have recently launched Coveo solutions, continuously optimizing their experience with intelligent search and knowledge management best practices. As the leader of this team, you'll be on a mission to ensure consistent value is delivered through our Customer Success Managers' mandate as they drive customer engagement, adoption, and satisfaction ensuring our customers are getting value from their Coveo investment.
<br><br>
You will wear both strategic and tactical hats, having responsibility for everything from setting overall engagement strategy to defining the necessary processes and deliverables required to realize this strategy, through coaching and training team members to execute it. Your direct scope will encompass the post-sales customer lifecycle, and you will also work with product, services and sales leadership to design and implement changes that improve the overall customer experience.
<br><br>
There won't be any typical day in this position, but some priorities to focus on:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Day-to-day management and coaching - Manage the day-to-day activities of the Customer Success team - balancing workloads, managing escalations, removing roadblocks, developing individual skills, coaching and motivating the team</li>
<li>Scaling team - Recruit, develop, and retain a team of Customer Success Managers focused on driving value-realization, adoption, and ultimately renewals</li>
<li>Operational Processes - Design and implement best-practice processes to cost-effectively support all accounts, from large high-touch accounts to mid-market medium-touch accounts and small low-touch accounts</li>
<li>Tools - create and maintain playbooks, implementation plans, and deliverables for each account segment - including post-implementation launch, value definition, user training, strategic business reviews, voice of the customer "listening" posts (e.g. on product usage, NPS)</li>
<li>Metrics - define metrics relevant to measuring customer health and Customer Success Manager performance, put the processes in place to collect these metrics, and use them to manage customer health and CSM performance; own Customer Retention/Churn and CSAT numbers</li>
<li>Internal stakeholder management - Effectively collaborate and communicate with other functional teams to ensure that CSM goals and initiatives are aligned with goals across the organization (sales, technical support, product, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<br>You're an inspiring leader, willing to roll up your sleeves?

<br><br>
You'll need to work independently and to deliver on detail as well as strategy, always ready to assist wherever needed! If you're able to quickly grasp and simply present complex technological and business concepts, and you're a highly process-oriented individual with superior strategic and analytical skills; that might be the right opportunity for you!
