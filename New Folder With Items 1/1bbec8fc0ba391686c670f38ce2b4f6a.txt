<p>
The Chicago Academy for the Arts (chicagoacademyforthearts.org), Illinois’ premier visual and performing arts high school, seeks a full-time marketing associate.</p>
<p>
The Academy’s educational model is “co-curricular”: students engage in rigorous, college-preparatory academic classes for five hours each day before immersing themselves in 3-5 hours of daily professional-level training in Dance, Media Arts, Music, Musical Theatre, Theatre, or Visual Arts. (Note: The Chicago Academy for the Arts is a different school than “ChiArts,” a CPS school.)</p>
<p>
Students at The Academy are characterized by an extraordinary sense of purpose and community. Most continue with the arts after high school: alums include hit songwriters, Grammy Award winners, Broadway stars, and award-winning and critically acclaimed dancers, filmmakers, actors, visual artists, and writers. Students also pursue degrees and careers outside of the arts: many alums are working in the fields of science, mathematics, technology, business, and law.</p>

The Marketing Associate is a full-time position, reporting to the Director of Marketing &amp; Communications. This is a year-round position that is critical to the operation of The Academy’s communication plan to a community of faculty, staff, trustees, students, families, alumni, donors, supporters, and the general public.
