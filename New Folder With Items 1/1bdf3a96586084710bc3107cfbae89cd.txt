<p><b>Job Summary</b></p>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<p>Working as part of a team, you will play an integral role in creating peace of mind for Alliance Data Card Services and our associates by protecting company assets, minimizing risk, and ensuring overall safety and security at assigned location. This is not a typical “security guard” position sitting at a static post having limited interaction with others, instead it is a highly interactive position in a fast-paced environment that values our security team. While prior law enforcement or security experience is preferred, it is not required. We will train you to provide and maintain a safe working environment for our associates, contractors, and visitors, how to actively patrol and respond to potential threats against the company, and how to act as a first-responder in emergency situations. As a Security Officer, you will provide best-in-class security for Alliance Data Card Services, conducting focused patrols in order to protect people, property and information within your assigned area of responsibility. You will work as part of a team, but must also be prepared to act independently as the situation may warrant, as you will at times be the only security officer available to respond to incidents, answer questions or independently assess situations to formulate response actions.</p>
