<p><b>About Omnitail</b></p>
<p>Our number one goal at Omnitail is to offer greater accountability and performance for our clients. The digital marketing industry suffers from a lack of transparency and integrity among agencies and vendors. We aim to change this trend by teaching our clients to measure success through profit, rather than just revenue or efficiency. We incorporate measures of COGS, VOH (variable overhead) and merchandise return rate (MRR) in our optimization process. We pride ourselves on working with each client to find the approach that works best for their specific business needs. Success through metrics like profit - not just revenue - equals greater accountability, integrity, and transparency: and that’s what Omnitail is all about.</p>
