<h2>Product Advocate</h2>

<div></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>At Atlassian, our Product Advocates are the "possibility experts" who not only wow potential clients but also help them to understand the solutions that our products can provide. This position will both use and stretch your technical skills, as you'd be helping development and project teams learn how they can use our tools for effective practices.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
Our sales model is atypical … and it rocks. The process begins with our products, which have to be compelling or everything stalls. Marketing then works to get the word out and more eyeballs on our products. Our Product Advocate group backs this up by equipping new users with tips, tricks, and how-to’s prior to and during their product evaluations. It is a transparent, client-driven sales process, which is how we believe sales should be done. Selling here is driven by customers, fueled by the products themselves, and propelled further by Advocate-led product guidance.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
Our team has metrics more closely aligned with a customer support team than a sales team. You’re not measured on hitting sales targets. Our success metrics are ticket volume, response time, and customer satisfaction. We need folks who are passionate about giving accurate, helpful information to our evaluators so they can make an informed decision. We rely on our products, and our knowledgeable team of Product Advocates explaining the benefits of those products, to drive sales.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
As a result of these conversations, we gain very interesting insights into what our evaluators expect, want, and struggle with. We have a captive audience internally at Atlassian who is eager to hear these insights so they can continue to improve our products, and our evaluation and purchasing experience.</div>

<div><b>More About Our Team</b></div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
The Product Advocate group champions our customers and products within Atlassian. The majority of our time is spent helping customers 'on the front lines', and then working internally to voice their product needs. Our work and success, first and foremost, is learning all we can about the clients and their needs to offer legendary service. We aggregate this information and collaborate with Product Management and Product Marketing to help define product strategy. As a Product Advocate, you’d be responsible for managing customer requests, responding to those requests, and providing insight to the rest of the Advocate team and other stakeholders on challenges and opportunities our customers recognize when evaluating our products.</div>
