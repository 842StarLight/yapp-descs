NexRep has one of the best performing sales forces in the United States, and it all starts with our certification process, sales process and scripting. We offer consistent sales support and guidance to our agents so you can perform at the highest level and make the highest commission on the sales you make.

These clients have a better educated consumer who is ready to make a purchase, which leads to higher close rates and average order value for our sales agents and more commission in your paycheck. You will also save thousands of dollars yearly on commuting, vehicle repairs, gas, food and clothing expenditures.</p>

<p>Many NexRep independent agents generate the equivalent of $15 per hour while the best agents are exceeding the equivalent of $25 per hour, which you can do too! NexRep agents have the freedom to choose their hours and availability. Contracting from home without the requirement of an 8-hour “shift” allows agents the flexibility to balance business and family. NexRep agents can grow their income by applying experience, skills, and certification they gain to optimize their hours, instead of waiting for a 2% annual increase from their employer. Unlike other companies that provide home-based opportunities, you will not just be a number in a report. From your initial phone assessment through certification to live-calls, NexRep’s experienced, professional staff provides the personalized support that will enable you to reach your full potential.</p>
