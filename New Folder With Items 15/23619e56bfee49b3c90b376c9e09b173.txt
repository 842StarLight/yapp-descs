Overview
<br><br>
Valorus, a Carnegie Technologies company, makes fintech frictionless by providing companies with a fintech solution that creates additional revenue streams for your business rather than costing you money. We do this through a unique revenue-sharing model and a number of products that create value for both you and your end users.
<br><br>
<b>Our fintech solution has four main components:</b> a mobile wallet/virtual bank with a physical Visa[Symbol] debit card; payroll processing; merchant processing; and a financing enablement engine. With these products, customers can create a white-labeled virtual bank and physical debit card that your end users can use. Our customers can eliminate payroll fees and merchant process fees while allowing end users to receive and transfer money in real-time. Our customers can also enable instant international money transfers without the need for other 3rd party providers. Valorus makes it easy for your customers to access and move money—all within your white-labeled wallet.
<br><br>
To reduce churn and increase brand loyalty, Valorus also offers a number of value-added services including engagement and rewards, media streaming, communications solutions, and wellness products. Once end users are using our platform, keep them engaged with these solutions that double as additional revenue streams for you.
<br><br>
If you are looking to advance your sales career – look no further. As a fast-growing Austin start-up, we are rapidly expanding our sales team.
