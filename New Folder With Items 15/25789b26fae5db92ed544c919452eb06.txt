<h2>Digital Marketing Manager</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">305 Fitness is a next-generation brand that's disrupting the conversation women have with and about their bodies, one ass shake at a time.
<br><br>
Traditionally, fitness marketers have been focused on quick fixes, before/after photos, and promises they can't keep. 305 is a disruptive brand in the $4BN health/wellness industry because it flips the notion that women need to change their bodies in order to be loved. We are a people-powered community that celebrates a woman as a whole being — for her humor, her intelligence, her ambition — not just the number on the scale.
<br><br>
We've been called the "bad little sister of boutique fitness" and the "most politically active fitness brand" by Well &amp; Good. We're backed by some of the biggest names in the music and entertainment industry. We've been featured on TODAY, Good Morning America, Refinery 29, The Washington Post, and more, for our unique message that exercise can be a means of self-expression.
<br><br>
<b>At our core is one simple premise:</b> learn from our customer and deliver exceptional services that make people feel included, not ashamed. Our clients are obsessed with our brand, as noted by our well-above industry average engagement across email and social platforms.
<br><br>
Since opening in 2012, we've meticulously laid the foundation of a beloved brand with a highly engaged following. In the next three years, we will be undergoing tremendous growth. We are tripling our studio footprint, jumping into digital, and spreading the 305 message through instructor certification nationwide.
<br><br>
