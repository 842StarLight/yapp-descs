When evaluating a Business Intelligence Analyst, we are looking for some key traits that will make them successful in our environment:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Curiosity – You don't settle to answer the questions given to you. Being uniquely positioned close to the data, your expertise is trusted to know the next questions to ask and identify the root of an issue. Although you may be interested in a topic, you need to have the curiosity to dig deeper into data to ensure that the narrative holds true at all levels. You don't wait for someone to ask you why. Exploring "what if" scenarios are something you might do just in case there is something further worth exploring.</li>
<li>Skeptical – You don't necessarily accept the first answer to a question as the truth. You uncover secondary layers before proving or invalidating assumptions. You're aware that data is never at rest, and cautious to proclaim an outcome without proving it in multiple ways. Because you accept that data collection is not a flawless process, you are always able to step back from your own work and question the outcome to ensure it stands up.</li>
<li>Methodical – You apply the scientific method to a hypothesis, and follows a structured approach to validating conclusions. You pride yourself in taking others on the journey to reach the conclusion so they can validate and share the same view. You hold your work to the highest standards and are not afraid to identify the constraints or edge cases where the model cannot give reasonable insights.</li>
<li>Analytical - Given a statement, you are able to decompose it into the sum of its parts, and provide alternate views of the data. The fact of 78% repeat customers to you is an opportunity to learn more about what makes up that number - possible cohorts, contributing and diverging factors.</li>
