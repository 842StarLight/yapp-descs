About Callcap:</b></h3>
<p>Callcap started in 2001 as a “peg-count” call tracking company. Customers purchase a few phone numbers from us and put a unique phone number on each of their advertising pieces. We then report which phone number (and so which ad) generated the most calls. Today, this is still the core of our offering, but we’ve expanded on our original goal of providing businesses with actionable insight into their business from the perspective of their phones.</p>
<p>
Our Callsurance service allows every incoming call to be monitored and graded according to customized criteria – usually whether it led to a sale or not. Our system of configurable alerts and advanced reporting lets business owners keep tabs on the performance of their employees and their advertising pieces – providing both training opportunities and data to justify budgets. Immediate missed opportunity alerts even give businesses a second chance at overcoming customer objections to recover a lost sale. This feature, Callsaver, generates more than a half billion per year in otherwise lost revenue for our customers.</p>
<p>
While these are the frontline of our business offerings, we offer our customers much more. Features such as outbound call tracking, broadcast messaging and surveys, a group voice messaging system, credit card number scrubbing, voice transcription, call report card grading, and soon plug-and-play call center monitoring without the need for separate tracking phone numbers. We’ve got many more projects in the pipeline and are looking for your help and your ideas.</p>
