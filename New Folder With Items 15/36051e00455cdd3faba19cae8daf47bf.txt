<p><b>We are dedicated to growing local businesses around the world. Are you ready to join in?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
Groupon’s mission is to become the daily habit in local commerce and fulfill our purpose of building strong communities through thriving small businesses by connecting people to a vibrant, global marketplace for local services, experiences and goods. In the process, we’re positively impacting the lives of millions of customers and merchants globally. Even with thousands of employees spread across multiple continents, we still maintain a culture that inspires innovation, rewards risk-taking and celebrates success. If you want to take more ownership of your career, then you're ready to be part of Groupon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
At Groupon, our merchants are the heart of who we are and why we do it. As an Account Manager, you will connect with them every single day. We focus on nurturing relationships with Groupon merchants and providing them extraordinary levels of support. We spend our days learning about their needs and how to improve these relationships to ensure retention and growth of these accounts. You'll be responsible for answering inbound merchant questions and inquiries from our phone queue. Our merchants have questions - and you have answers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
We're a "best of both worlds" kind of company. We're big enough to have resources and scale, but small enough that a single person has a surprising amount of autonomy and can make a meaningful impact. We're curious, fun, a little intense, and kind of obsessed with helping local businesses thrive. Does that sound like a compelling place to work?</p>
