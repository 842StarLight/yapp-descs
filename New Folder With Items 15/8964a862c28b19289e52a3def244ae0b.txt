<h2>National Sales Associate - Inside Sales - Sales Rep</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>Dentists are not financial masterminds. There are a lot of balls to keep in the air regarding the traditional dental practices finances. Despite income, most dentists cannot figure out how to manage cash flow and maximize their own personal balance sheet. Despite a very successful dental practice, dentists are not financially where they should be.</p>
<p>Four Quadrants has cracked the code. Through our guaranteed and comprehensive approach of business advisory, personal advisory, accounting, and investing, we know how to turn successful dentists into multi-millionaires. However, dentists are busy people. They are focused on their practice. They donâ€™t know that the code has been cracked.</p>
<p>We need 2 strong salespeople to help us connect, qualify, and help these dentists become clients.</p>
<p>Qualified candidates must have prior success selling to established business owners. Past experience selling to Dental practices is a bonus. If having a non-territory driven sales position with more meaningful and intimate 1-on-1 conversations with dentists/specialists that own their practice and their spouses are what you are looking for, this position may be ideal for you. Our current sales team has between 5-10 calls/conversations with successful dentists in a normal week in addition to traveling to our national speaking events that typically host between 10-40 dentist attendees.</p>
<p>You must have a professional demeanor, sophisticated communication skills, and personal presence that draws people to listen to you.</p>

<li>You must know how to overcome adversity because you hate to lose.</li>
<li>You must be goal oriented and have evidence of reaching ambitious goals through tactical planning, effective execution, and enough responsibility to learn and adapt from your mistakes.</li>
<li>All candidates must be able to work well independently, be self-confident authentic in their abilities and demeanor, and be someone who approaches the world with optimism.</li>
<li>You should be able to sell by blending humor, authenticity, and intelligent yet compelling conversations.</li>
<li>You must have prior success selling to top management and decision makers in a competitive market.</li>
<li>You must excel at finding and closing new opportunities and have both excellent problem solving skills and consultative selling skills.</li>
<li>You must be effective at building and optimizing relationships to grow revenue and create a foundation for lasting success.</li>
