<br>Opportunity
<br>***********
<br><br>
Green Bits is the leading provider of retail Point of Sale solutions to the legal cannabis industry. This exciting market is rapidly growing, and Green Bits is growing with it. Our product covers everything from point of sale to inventory management and integration with state tracking systems. Our expertise in helping our retail customers stay compliant with state rules is what sets cannabis retail apart from all other types of retail, and what sets Green Bits apart from the competition.
<br><br>
We're looking for a senior to principal product manager to lead a major part of our product: our retail platform. The platform covers a lot of ground: all of the "back of house" features such as inventory management, reporting, and taxes, along with the APIs that the rest of the product is built on such as our registers. It includes areas not yet spun into their own teams, such as eCom and marketing services.
<br><br>
In this role, you'll be driving the strategy and execution for our retail platform. You'll be spending most of your time in an individual contributor capacity, leading specific platform initiatives.
<br><br>
You'll have one product manager with whom you can divide and conquer, and so we're also looking for good people management skills.
<br><br>
