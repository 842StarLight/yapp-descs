<h2>Strategic Account Executive - West</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>For the last 100 years, companies have operated primarily under a product-centric business model, where the goal was to make, ship, and sell more units. Today, there’s a demand to have products and services delivered on a continual, subscription basis; to upgrade and access new innovations and features constantly. This is the end of ownership and it changes everything. Our vision is “The World Subscribed” where one day every company will be a part of the Subscription Economy® (a phrase coined by our CEO, Tien Tzuo).</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>
Zuora’s leading, cloud-based software solution automates all subscription order-to-revenue operations in real-time for any business. Companies in any industry can launch new businesses, shift products to subscription, implement new pay-as-you-go pricing and packaging models, gain new insights into subscriber behavior, and disrupt market segments to gain competitive advantage.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>
Our growth story is only just beginning and our Sales team is pivotal in sustaining our rapid growth across the globe. We are looking for a highly collaborative, outcome-oriented Strategic Account Executive with an entrepreneurial spirit to help us take on this huge market opportunity.</p>

You’ll enable the most established software, hardware, media, telecom and IOT companies to sustain rapid growth, capture more subscribers and transform their entire business.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
This isn’t just any software sales role. This will be the most interesting sale you’ve ever made as you, a trusted business partner take a seat at the decision-making table and pioneer business transformation with our future customers’ C-Suite and board members. You will be the CEO aka “ZEO” of your territory and career – owning, driving the strategy and leading the sales cycle with a cross-functional team including our award-winning customer service team.
