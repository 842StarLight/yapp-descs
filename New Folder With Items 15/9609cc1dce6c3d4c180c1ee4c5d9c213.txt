What's the opportunity?</b></h3>
<p>
We are looking for a SaaS marketing expert who will play a critical role in driving the continued growth and direction of our company.

We believe the right person can point <i>us</i> in the right direction, guide <i>us</i>, come up with campaigns, be resourceful enough to get them produced, manage the process, study the results, course correct, revamp, and try more things. In addition to big-picture strategy, you'll be focused on day-to-day execution while collaborating closely with our Product, Engineering, and Customer teams.</p>
<p>
You’re creative. You’re organized. You’re experienced. You’ve done this before. You want to do it again. You will report directly to our CEO and <i>work</i> alongside 30 other people who are here to support you and cheer you on.<br>
