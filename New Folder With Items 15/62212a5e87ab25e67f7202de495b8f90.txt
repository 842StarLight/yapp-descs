Job Description:</b></h2>
<p>
Leidos makes the world safer, healthier, and more efficient through information technology, engineering and science. <b>careC2</b>™, a Leidos Health Products and Services business, is delivering on this mission with a next generation care coordination software solution that enables the healthcare enterprise to effectively and efficiently manage the delivery of care. This single, consolidated environment for managing episodes of care with a real-time, common view for all care providers – including patients, families, clinicians, and other caregivers or coordinators – reduces variation and potential issues as it follows the patient through each phase of their medical care treatment, measuring how well the care providers are performing against an expected outcome. We are re-imagining how we provide visibility, oversight, and management of patients across the entire care continuum that is based on consolidated views of the patient’s priorities and holistic, actionable insights aimed at improving productivity and enhancing the patient experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
We seek experienced health care disruptors driven to push the boundaries of what healthcare is and redefining aspects of the industry altogether. We need motivated individuals who want to run fast and shape a new product-line business that is well supported by a large, well-established and aggressively growing organization.</p>

Product Strategy Analyst</b></p>
<p>
The <b>careC2 Product Strategy Analyst</b> supports the <b>careC2</b> Product and Engineering team. The position reports to the Director of <b>careC2</b> Product Strategy and is based in Charlotte, NC or Morgantown, WV, with remote work arrangements considered.</p>
