<h2>Business Development Representative</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>We are Proformex, a Cleveland-based software company that is disrupting the life insurance industry. Our software helps fiduciaries and agents monitor policies on behalf of beneficiaries. We’re looking for a BDR/SDR to help us scale. This is a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of an exciting growth business and help shape our success in a role with wide ranging responsibilities. As one of the first dedicated BDRs you will play an important role in helping us building out a repeatable sales model and take our technology to the world.</p>
<p>POSITION QUALIFICATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>Are you competitive? Do you thrive on hitting targets and surpassing expectations? Are you great with people and driven to find solutions others do not see? As the first BDR, you will be responsible for nurturing and developing leads into qualified sales opportunities, as well as supporting the sales team with prospect development. This role will be a fast-paced challenge, and you will need to bring your energy every day. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside an amazing, talented and dedicated team that is up to any challenge and plans to have fun every step along the path to success.</p>
<p>We are looking for someone who has experience as a BDR/SDR in an early or growth stage SaaS company. You may not have been the first BDR but you were early enough to have learned techniques, methods and processes for sourcing leads quickly. You know the tools of the trade and how to get the most out of them. You are a master of cold email, and aren't afraid to pick up the phone. And you know how to deal with rejection.</p>
<p>Your communication skills are paramount: Can you articulate the value proposition of our product clearly? Can you find out politely, and without being too pushy, whether a prospect has the need, authority and a timeline in mind? Can you leave a professional impression about Proformex even if the lead does not qualify?</p>
<p>You’re motivated by success. This goes without saying really, but you love to win. That said, you’re not someone who will win at all costs. You’re respected and maybe even loved by your peers, your previous managers would all want to work with you again if given the opportunity.
