College Possible is a growing nonprofit coaching low-income students to and through college to break the cycle of poverty and empower the next generation of leaders. Our model earns top-of-field results: a 2011 Harvard study found that the program more than doubles a student's chance of enrolling in a four-year college, and our students are four times more likely to become college graduates than their low-income peers. College Possible has a budget of $22 million, more than 130 full-time employees and more than 270 AmeriCorps and VISTA service members. During the 2019-20 school year, we will reach an estimated 25,000 students in all 50 states, at more than 100 partner high schools and at more than 400 colleges.</p>
<p>
College Possible has a growth and scaling strategy called <i>Catalyze</i> that holds the potential to reach tens of thousands more low-income college students over the next decade and close degree attainment gaps. Through its <i>Catalyze</i> initiative, College Possible builds the capacity of colleges/universities to adopt and integrate its proven coaching model into their infrastructure to better support students from low-income backgrounds and boost retention rates. College Possible trains and supports its post-secondary partners in hiring and managing near-peer AmeriCorps coaches who utilize a research-based curriculum to support students and help them navigate the common obstacles to graduation.</p>
<p>
College Possible is committed to equity, diversity and inclusion, and seeks to build a diverse workforce to promote effective partnership with the communities we serve. We welcome a diverse pool of qualified applicants. For each of its positions, College Possible is mindful about what best serves our students, and seeks to hire staff with relevant experience, skills and aptitude, and a commitment to the power of education.</p>

Headquartered in Saint Paul, Minnesota, College Possible also operates in Philadelphia, PA; Chicago, IL; Milwaukee, WI; Omaha, NE; and Portland, OR; and has Catalyze partnerships in California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, and Tennessee. We're joining forces with colleges to achieve a transformational impact: by 2021, we will partner with 400 colleges to reach 50,000 students.</p>
