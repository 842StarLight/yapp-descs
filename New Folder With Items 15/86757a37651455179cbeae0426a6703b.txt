<p>Misys and D+H joined forces in June 2017 to create a diversified global financial software provider, unmatched in terms of depth and breadth of solutions. Operating under the new company name, Finastra, the combination will create the third largest financial services technology company in the world.
</p>
<p>Finastra has approximately 10,000 employees and over 9,000 customers across 130 countries, including 48 of the top 50 banks globally. This follows the acquisition of D+H by Vista Equity Partners, which already owns Misys, creating a merger of two highly complementary financial technology providers. Finastra has U.S. $2.1 billion* in revenues and has offices in 42 countries around the world. It is headquartered in London, UK, with North American headquarters in Toronto, Canada.
</p>
<p>The businesses of Finastra are highly complementary and create a strong, unified, global FinTech company, enabling customers to deploy mission critical solutions, delivered on premises, hosted, or via the cloud. The company’s open architecture and approach enables financial institutions to harness the power of software ecosystems, offering the broadest set of retail banking, transaction banking, lending, and treasury and capital markets software capabilities available in the world.
</p>
<p>Increased scale and geographic reach mean that Finastra can serve customers better, regardless of their size or geographic location - from global banks, to community banks, credit unions, and corporations.
</p>
<p>Through the Finastra open, secure and reliable solutions, their customers will be empowered to accelerate growth, optimize cost, mitigate risk, and continually evolve to deliver a superior customer experience, both now and in the future.
</p>
<p>The Finastra product strategy is ‘Protect, Extend and Innovate’. This includes protecting their customer’s investments in all of their solutions; extending the value of their solutions by integrating new products and services; and innovating to create best-in-class solutions. This strategy, in combination with the unrivalled breadth and depth of their solution offerings, and open architecture and approach, means that they are well positioned to help their customers, whatever their size or location.
