<h2>Auto Glass Spotter</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<div>What we are currently looking for is what is called a Spotter. This person is the frontline face of our company for customers and our partner dealerships. This would be a starter position with the potential to go into either sales or become a technician. But first we need to know how well you can follow directions, observe your resourcefulness and determine your level of customer service.<br>
<br>
<b>As a spotter, your primary responsibilities would be:</b>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Spot damaged windshield with chips and/or cracks.</li>
<li>
Write down vehicle and customer information.</li>
<li>
Sending the appropriate information through a software channel on a mobile device.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div><b>
Secondary responsibilities include:</b></div>
<ul>
<li>
Assist greeting customers.</li>
<li>
Assisting with driving cars forward at dealership service centers.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
Once you have proven proficiency doing this over a 1-2 week period, we will have you trained in rock chip repairs to allow you to earn commissions. Commissions are also available on the windshield replacements that are spotted and successfully completed. Other avenues of earning income will become available as you show your level of ambition and work ethic. We like performers and therefore we like to pay for performance.</div>
