<h2>IT Sales Executive (New Business Development - Fresno)</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>We're a kick %$# managed IT services company that clients rave about and competitors want to be. At just over 30 employees, we are still nimble but growing rapidly and our top-notch technology services (Managed services, cloud services &amp; professional services) are in high demand throughout the state of California. We are looking for a passionate, proven business development executive who has some technology experience. But enough about us, let's talk about you.</p>
<ul><li> You are a proven sales professional who clients like and trust.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> You believe that business development (solution sales) is a high calling and a worthy profession, and you have taken the time to hone your skills.</li></ul>
<ul><li> You like to educate clients and help them find the best solutions, not push products or sell on price.</li></ul>
<ul><li> You are confident in what you sell but humble enough to listen to your clients. You inspire trust.</li></ul>
<ul><li> You relish the opportunity to grow a new territory and sell without commission caps or limitations. You cultivate success, both for your clients and for yourself.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> People would describe you as friendly, smart, optimistic and resilient.</li></ul>
<ul><li> You have an existing network of business contacts and friends (ideally in healthcare, municipal government, legal or professional services industries)</li></ul>
<ul><li> You're not afraid to blaze new territories, meet new people, and develop new relationships. You're also not afraid to ask for the close.</li></ul>
<ul><li> You enjoy the process of educating your prospects, using business language that they understand, not just dumping technical jargon on them.</li></ul>
<ul><li> You're willing to put in hard work to get great results.</li></ul>
<ul><li> You like to listen and discover needs before you sell anything. You're as interested in finding the right solution and ensuring the prospect's needs are met as you are in closing the deal (and you really like to close the deal).</li></ul>
<ul><li> You don't just want to be a cog in the system, you want to make an impact and be a key contributor, recognized for the value you bring to the company.</li></ul>
<ul><li> You're probably already employed, and making good money regularly exceeding quotas, but you're ready for a new challenge, an un-capped opportunity, or more freedom.</li></ul>
<ul><li> You'd like to work for an entrepreneurial company; a company on the cutting-edge of new technology and new growth; but you also want to know your future is secure within an established business that offers great pay and benefits (including 401k, Medical, Dental and Vision Insurance, Paid Time Off, Company vehicle and/or travel reimbursement, Profit share bonuses, etc.).</li></ul>

If all of this describes you, then let's talk! We're growing our presence in Fresno and the Central Valley area and we have a position that we think would be perfect for just your type.</p>
