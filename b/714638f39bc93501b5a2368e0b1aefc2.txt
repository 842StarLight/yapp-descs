<h2>Warehouse Manager</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<b>THE COMPANY:</b> Serving farmers and equipment dealers throughout the USA, Canada, and farther abroad, Exapta Solutions Inc. is committed to providing specialized products for highly effective seeding of crops under no-tillage. Exapta continues to grow and diversify, with the agility of a small company, and the savvy and accolades that are the envy of the industry heavyweights.
<br><br>
<b>THE POSITION:</b> Exapta is currently seeking to fill a full-time warehouse manager/COO position. The primary functions will be to order, receive, and maintain proper inventory levels; pre-packing, quality control, and filling customer orders accurately and timely. Other priorities would include daily, weekly, monthly and yearly record-keeping, and working with various software programs. You will be managing other employees (or contractor labor) to assist you in executing these tasks (currently, our warehouse operates with 2 additional fulltime people, and 2 temps in the busy season). This is a combination of desk job &amp; hands-on in the warehouse; there’s a lot of multi-tasking involved.
<br><br>
<b>QUALIFICATIONS:</b> The candidate must have excellent organizational skills and ability to solve problems; will have integrity and honesty; and will be extremely conscientious of details and timeliness. The candidate will have good ‘people skills’ including the ability to effectively oversee work by other employees as well as collaboration with our sales staff, vendors, and customers (a small percentage of orders are picked up by the customer, rather than shipped out). The candidate will be energetic, able to work independently and without close supervision (i.e., a self-starter), and enthusiastic for the job at hand. We want someone who is proud of doing an important job and doing it well. We’re a young company with strong growth prospects - an exciting juncture for those who like to challenge themselves. Bachelor’s degree (or higher) preferred. Experience with warehouse and inventory management preferred. Solid computer skills needed. Do not apply if you don’t have these requirements. Do not apply unless you are excited about running an efficient warehouse and inventory system, and you are ready to work diligently―the Exapta sales staff are dependent on the warehouse operating smoothly.
<br><br>
<b>COMPENSATION:</b> Base salary is very competitive for the industry. Additional compensation based on performance benchmarks. Some flexibility of hours during non-peak season; 10% beyond your base salary paid into a SEP-IRA retirement account for you; paid vacation.
<br><br>
<b>APPLYING:</b> Send your résumé and 4 work-related references to exapta@gmail.com
<br><br>
<b>TIMELINE:</b> Position to be filled in August or early September (negotiable) to allow some time for training before our current manager rides off into the sunset. Interviews to be conducted in late July or early August.</div>
