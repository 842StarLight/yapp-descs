<b>Start Your Journey With Us</b>
<div>Marriott International is the world’s largest hotel company, with more brands, more hotels and more opportunities for associates to grow and succeed. We believe a great career is a journey of discovery and exploration. So, we ask, where will your journey take you?</div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<h1 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>JOB SUMMARY</b></h1>
 <div>In 2019, we are taking Marriott International’s User Centered Design group to a new level of excellence. As Director, Digital UX Design of the newly formed Digital Creative Studio, you will bring senior level experience to advance, elevate, and lead a consumer-obsessed design team.</div>
<div>This individual will be highly collaborative and responsible for leading a team to develop innovative and usable digital experiences anchored by research and data-driven design. In this role, you will define and advocate consistent, intuitive user experience across all our digital experiences – mobile, web, and on-property digital interactions across Marriott’s vast portfolio of brands.</div>
<br>
<div></div>
<div>A strong portfolio is critical for this role, both in terms of demonstrating your experience and as an example of your ability to create a compelling design presentation. Your portfolio should showcase experience in UX and interaction design, particularly where simplicity and ease-of-use were a major concern. Diversity of projects is equally as important as focus on curation and quality to choose a solid collection of outcomes and design intermediaries and deliverables (especially flows, mockups, and prototypes). Every example should demonstrate the design and thought process behind each image.</div>
<br>
<div></div>
<div>The ideal candidate will be responsible for delivering experiences that are measurable and drive higher conversion and satisfaction across all our digital products. Additionally, this position is responsible for providing oversight and direction to a team of interaction and visual designers, copywriters, and external agency partners to evolve our user experiences across multiple devices and platforms. A combination of agency and brand experience is ideal.</div>
<br>
<div></div>
<div>You’ll direct and design experiences that solve complex interactions with elegance and simplicity. The role’s broad scope will give you ample room to flex your design muscles—both on projects that have immediate impact on the business, as well as explorations that shape our long-term strategy, vision, and UX direction.</div>
<br>
<div></div>
<div>Cross-functional collaboration with product team leaders, global brand teams, IT, and research is essential to the success of this role. You should</div>
<div>be highly detailed surrounding communication of design principles and direction, as well as design specifications to multiple key stakeholders. You will be held accountable for total creative oversight, execution, quality of design, and on-time and on-strategy delivery.</div>
<br>
<div></div>
<div>Team mentality is mandatory to achieve and push for continued success as the global leader in hospitality. Our guests come first as we strive to achieve seamless on-property and digital experiences worldwide.</div>
