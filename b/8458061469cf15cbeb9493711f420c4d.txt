WHO IS DEPUTY?</b></div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
At Deputy our mission is to change how hourly employees are managed globally.</div>
<div>
Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported over 80 million hourly workers comprising over 60% of the US workforce in 2017. Global estimates are that hourly workers are 80 %– 90% of the workforce. Yet while hourly workers comprise such large majorities of both the U.S. and global workforces, there is a stark lack of software tools available today that directly address their needs.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
There are literally millions of workers and businesses clamoring for a technology-based solution to bring the mundane tasks associated with work and scheduling into the modern world.</div>
<div>
Deputy is changing all of that. Deputy provides a single, convenient application to handle shift scheduling, timesheets, tasking, and communication – a huge boon for managers and employees alike.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
Deputy believes in equal opportunity and that inclusiveness and diversity promotes innovation. Our global team members are from a variety of cultures. And we welcome different perspective and skills.</div>
