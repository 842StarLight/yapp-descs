Position Overview
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The <b>Collections Analyst</b> role is a key contributor to managing Accounts Receivable at Hubbell. The position is assigned our most complex and valuable customers and is expected to not only achieve the desired outcomes with those customers, but to provide thought leadership to others throughout the enterprise on opportunities to make the process work better for all stakeholders and model success for less experienced team members. This role seeks interactions with various internal teams (customer service, sales, as examples) in an effort to streamline the invoice to cash process; benefiting customers and fellow Hubbell employees equally. Analysts spend a considerable part of their time seeking, analyzing and socializing data to understand situations from all sides. Working with the system as-is, while at the same time defining and generating ideas about how to improve processes is a key responsibility. Seen as the “go-to” person when issues arise this role can confidently and competently determine recommendations for next steps in nearly all situations. Works collaboratively with all levels of customer and internal employees to achieve desired outcomes and build relationships. The role works and prioritizes effort independently but in unison with department and corporate objectives.</div>
