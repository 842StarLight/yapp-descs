<p><b>About our company culture and this position:</b><br>
Our company culture is the #1 reason people choose to work here, and stay once they're here. It'd be a mistake to say that things like our fun quarterly events, our no-dress-code, and our efficient 40 hour work week define our culture - they're the positive side effects of our culture. Our culture is built on good people who love their work, and work hard and intelligently to produce great results. We're grateful for the work we all do, and we tell each other that. We are a group of thoughtful, helpful people with integrity, and we get stuff done. When you have that, it doesn't really matter what clothes you wear or if you booked a 80 hour workweek (which we recommend against doing).</p>

<p>Are you interested in putting together your own software engineering team, building the architecture for a widely distributed software product, and working directly with company founders to create first-ever products? Are you able to build a team to support these products, and tie the products into the organization as a whole for world-class data analysis?</p>
<p>
We’re a people-first, culturally-focused company that drives at real results. If you’ve got the experience of putting together a great team and executing on challenging product vision, and thrive in an environment with little bureaucracy - you’ll make a great impact here. If you’re looking for an easier gig, or one where there’s a wide and deep team already in place and you’ve just got to “not mess it up” - do not apply to this job.</p>

<p><b>What does a VP of Technology do, anyway?</b></p>
<div>
<p>Our fast-growing company utilizes a wide range of technology to drive our products and support our customers around the world. This leadership-level hire will work closely with the co-founders, and be accountable for the execution of their vision - including planning and architecture, product development and design, security, availability, and building a team. The primary existing tech product you’ll be working with is RapidCut - this amazing platform, which is currently in use in 700+ retail locations in over 45 countries, is a cloud-connected 2D cutting plotter that allows our retailers all over the world to make our line of mobile accessories in seconds at the store. In addition, we’re building even more status-quo challenging hardware and software products over the next several years.</p>
<p>
Reporting to the co-founders, you’ll have an IT Manager and several outsourced developers reporting to you, as well as the ability to build an internal and/or external team as you see fit. This position will not have to deal with internal IT / and internal help desk items, and will only be working on revenue-producing associated tech projects.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><b>In plain terms, here’s what this usually means:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create and maintain a tech roadmap with clear prioritization, while keeping the tech team focused on the goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recruit, build, and manage a team, both internally and externally, to execute the vision of the co-founders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look around corners to ensure the platforms, architecture, and systems are adequate for the stage and growth plans of the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set and capture metrics that measure the success of the tech team and products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work closely with the leadership team to take all areas of the business in to account, including Marketing, Sales, Finance, Operations, and Product R&amp;D.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and leverage, when appropriate, new technologies and products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are a company that ships, so doing all the above on-time, on-budget, and in a way that drives true, usable value for our team and our customers is critical. Until it ships and customers love it, it doesn’t count.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A deep understanding and experience of what makes a great company culture, and building/leading your team in line with our Core Values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hands-on technical leadership, including application architecture design, code reviews, release responsibilities, production support, etc.</p>
<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t need to be an expert in all of our tech stack, but you should have expertise in at least some, with proficiency in many, and the ability to fill in the gaps by learning. Here’s what you’ll find under the hood:</p>
