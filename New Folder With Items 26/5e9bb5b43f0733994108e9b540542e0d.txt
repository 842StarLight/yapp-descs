<p>Make an Impact. Be immersed into real work experiences. Grow your knowledge and learning.</p>
<p>
Allsteel, a signature brand within HNI Corporation, has summer internship opportunities for students pursuing a Business, Marketing, or Sales degree and are looking to expand their knowledge this summer growing their skills in a fast-paced manufacturing environment.</p>
<p>
Our culture is built around Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) and the notion that every member has something unique and valuable to contribute. We have found that when our people share their ideas, and leadership acts on those ideas, we achieve something powerful: individuals working actively to make the company better.</p>
<p>
As an Intern with the Allsteel Sales Development Program, you join a fast-paced, highly visible team with a vision and passion for implementing solutions and exceeding our customers’ expectations. While no day will be the same, you can expect to put the knowledge you have gained in the classroom to use each day in a variety of experiences. Our interns receive a project (or two!) for the summer and work directly with a mentor for technical and professional guidance. Our interns are challenged and charged with seeking better ways of conducting business . . . continually asking . . . How can this be improved?</p>
<p>
Our Sales Internship experience will provide you the opportunity to the link inside and field sales team and our targeted distribution to increase sales and profitability. You will have high exposure and accessibility to our Allsteel Leadership Team. You will provide sales support services, develop relationships with dealers, and collaborate with internal Allsteel product, marketing, and dealer loyalty departments. You will regularly utilize remote technology and communication skills to advise dealers on product, sales materials, and strategic selling. We will provide tools, training, and hands-on experience to help you succeed.</p>
