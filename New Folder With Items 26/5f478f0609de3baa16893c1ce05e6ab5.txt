The Ideal Candidate:</b></p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
This role is an opportunity to be more than a behind-the-scenes developer or simply a reporting partner to business stakeholders. It’s a chance to do both at the same time, in a unique hybrid position that will allow you to leverage your hard technical skills in database management and business intelligence platforms, and combine that with your softer skills in communication and business partnering to make positive impacts across the organization.</p>
<p>
The team is looking for someone who brings that fundamental technical background but, perhaps more importantly, has the ability and confidence to build meaningful relationships with cross functional leaders and be an active part of designing solutions. This is the kind of position that takes someone with curiosity and initiative, as it will come with direction but also an expectation that you’re capable of working with autonomy. The manager is looking for someone who wants to lead.</p>
