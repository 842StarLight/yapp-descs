<p>Financial firms rely on dozens of critical systems to develop and execute strategies, evaluate risk, track P&amp;L, lead sales and trading, and handle settlement. The constant challenge is the complexity of integrating and effectively monitoring these systems so that data moves correctly across the enterprise, at higher speeds and lower costs. Building solutions in-house can take a large team and a larger investment. Integrators and consultants may not understand a firm’s business model or data. That’s where we come in.<br>

Providing common tools, services and expertise, we enable firms to simplify technology relationships, which ultimately drive lower total cost of ownership, faster time to market and improved transparency.
