<br><br>
But we're not done, and that's where you come in.
<br><br>
Kony is looking for Enterprise Sales Executives to drive the sale of the Kony DBX digital banking platform and application suite. If you are the kind of person who enjoys digital transformation, hunting new opportunities, building territories, and working their way into new financial institutions to uncover needs and deliver best in class solutions, then this could be your dream job!
<br><br>
<b>How you will make an impact:</b><br>
You will use your experience in selling digital/mobile banking or other banking software, to build a territory and introduce the Kony DBX platform to new financial institutions. You're hungry, tenacious, and collaborative, but also have the ability to be a team player and leverage your network—both external and internal (we're talking everyone from sales to marketing to customer success to admins).
<br><br>
You understand customer business needs—and more importantly, how you/Kony DBX can solve those needs. In other words: you're a product evangelist and not only do you know what you're talking about, you actually understand what you're talking about. You have a track record of developing relationships with C-level executives across the enterprise, but you're also willing to make cold calls and prospect within your territory.
<br><br>
While we have aggressive sales and growth goals that you will be a vital part of, you won't have to go it alone (remember that internal network we mentioned earlier?). Kony and DBX SEs partner with management to define the best strategy to execute sales goals, and SEs work closely not only with the entire sales org, but the rest of the company as well. In other words—we've got this.
<br><br>
<b>What it means to be a Mobilizer:</b><br>
Here at Kony, employees are MOBILIZERS - someone who acts and inspires to build a digital world. Being a mobilizer means that we realize that our impact goes far beyond our job function. We're a global company with a local heartbeat. We have over 1500 mobilizers across the globe, but we emphasize making time for local service and volunteer events through our company-sponsored and individual initiatives. Connecting with people is a part of all we do—from apps to volunteer events.
<br><br>
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</div>
