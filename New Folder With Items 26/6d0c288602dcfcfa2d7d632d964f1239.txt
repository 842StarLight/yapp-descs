<h2>Mortgage Loan Officer</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>We are looking to hire salary based Loan Officer/Partners to join our team.</p>
<p>This is different in that we are looking for two totally different types of people for our team.</p>
<p><b><i>Loan Partner</i></b> We will provide the borrower and your job will be to take the application and take the client all the way from there to closing.</p>
<p>This is for the LO that loves working on the loan, but doesn’t like to “go get new business”, yet you want to be 100% paid by salary. Your passion is putting together excellent files and getting them to closing quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>You are unhappy, and edgy when you have to be the rainmaker.</p>
<p>You may have felt like a “square peg” being forced into round “sales” hole and you may have been disillusioned and considered quitting the industry. In fact, there has really never been a place for a loan officer who was good at working files but didn’t like selling….until now.</p>
<p><b><i>Loan Officer</i></b> Your “Business of Awesomeness” is to be out shaking hands, kissing babies. Getting appointments with referral partners is easy for you.
