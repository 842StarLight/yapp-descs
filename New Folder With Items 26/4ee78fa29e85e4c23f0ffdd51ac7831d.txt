<p>
We are seeking talented and ambitious people who have a track record of strong performance.</p>
<p>
We value all of our team partners and go the extra mile to make sure you receive a career experience that fits your goals. You will become extremely knowledgeable in various ideal customer profiles, buyer journeys, and the tenets of a world-class client success organization as we build it. You will also learn how to work in a startup environment where you have the opportunity to learn a wider set of skills than you would be working for a more mainstream company.</p>
<p>
Account Manager responsibilities include retaining and growing customer relationships, selling a vision to marketing leaders in customer accounts, mentoring the Customer Success Managers in a team environment, and building bridges between customers and our product, design, and data science teams. This position will require travel once or twice a month.</p>

If you have domain expertise in B2B marketing, can close eight-figure deals, and work cross-functionally, we'd like to meet you. Candidates for this role will have a proven track record of achieving ambitious individual and team-wide sales quotas.</p>

Ultimately, a successful Account Manager should collaborate with customers and our product, data science, and operations teams to achieve quotas while keeping our clients satisfied and engaged with our products and services in the long-run.<br>
