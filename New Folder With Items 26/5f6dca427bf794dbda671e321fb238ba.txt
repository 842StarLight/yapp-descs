 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>Are you great at financial analysis, strong with data and details while still understanding the big picture? Can you provide insightful sales and profit analysis to a complex and growing business, and bring those insights into action across different functional teams? We are looking for someone with strong financial and quantitative chops who can explain complex dynamics in simple terms, and who drives an investment mindset that enhances enterprise value.</p>
<p>
Custom Ink, the leader in custom apparel for groups and communities, is all about bringing people together. That's what inspires our innovative online platform, world-class customer support, and award-winning work environment. With 1,600+ team members (“Inkers”), we are passionate about the success and well-being of our team and have earned frequent recognition as a top workplace from such organizations as Fortune Magazine and The Washington Post. Our customers are counting on us to come through for them, and that’s important to all Inkers - no matter what role they’re in.</p>
<p><b>
How you’ll make a difference:</b></p>
<p>
As Manager of Financial Planning &amp; Analysis, you will be a high-visibility, collaborative thought partner, embedded with key stakeholders across the company. You will analyze financial and operating results, develop projections of future performance, and assess opportunities to drive increased growth and profitability. You will develop actionable insights to help the company understand key business drivers, highlight risks and opportunities, and influence strategic decision making that will drive meaningful improvements. You must be comfortable gathering and handling confidential information, understanding complex business dynamics, and developing projections with strong quantitative and conceptual underpinnings. This role will work closely with Inkers across multiple business functions, so the ability to collaborate, build credibility and trust, and ‘connect the dots’ between operational factors and value creation are critical to success. Turning insights into impact will require strong oral and written communication skills. Furthermore, the position will require meeting tight deadlines for the many people relying on your work, so attention to detail, good time management, and grace under pressure will be important.</p>
