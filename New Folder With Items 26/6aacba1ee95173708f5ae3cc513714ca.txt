<div><b>Role</b></div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
We are looking for an experienced front-end software engineer who has a passion for building intuitive user interfaces, writing maintainable and reusable UX components using React JS, contributing best practices and collaborating with a team of fellow world-class engineers who thrives in a collaborative team environment.</div>

<div><b>
About the Team</b></div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
At the core of any sales organization is the ability to know what to do, when to do it, and who should be performing the activities that lead to successful customer engagement. The Orchestration and Task Flow Team’s mission is to enable our customers to successfully execute on these goals.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
The Orchestration front-end provides our users with tools to create, modify, and manage sequences and their embedded features: the schedules, events, and action definitions that make things go. The Orchestration Service provides the automation and intelligence to keep track of when a task is due, who its assigned to and gathers intelligence about emails as they are delivered and received. We provide data driven insights from machine learning systems to help our customers take the optimal next step. At the end of the day, our team enables our customers to answer the question “How can organizations engage their prospects predictably, efficiently, and with the greatest impact?”</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
The fundamental challenges we’re solving next are helping users develop new tasks, flows, and assembling them into more advanced workflows all while keeping the system reliable and scalable as our users continue to double every year. Customers need insight into why something happened or why it didn’t, they need to see who they’re reaching and how often, and they need to understand what takes them a step closer to increase their chances of success. The Orchestration system provides that insight.</div>
