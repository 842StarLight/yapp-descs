<b>Overview of WorkHound:</b><br>
At WorkHound, we believe people should love the work they do. We live this as a team and through our product.
<br><br>
We are building the megaphone for workers that don't have a voice.
<br><br>
We've got a foothold in trucking, where the average company turns over 95% of their workers every year and spends ridiculous amounts of money in recruiting. The same thing happens in industries we're exploring, like nursing, warehousing, and manufacturing.
<br><br>
Why? Because workers don't feel respected. We amplify their voice, help companies understand the needs of their staff, and improve their culture in the process.
<br><br>
