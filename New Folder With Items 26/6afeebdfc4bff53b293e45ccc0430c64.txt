<p>*<br>Totally Weird Los Angeles is seeking a Multi-Media Advertising Sales Executive</p>
<p>We are growing exponentially and we need someone who can grow with us. We are seeking a smart, driven, and ambitious individual to build a solid client base, lead a team, and develop new markets. HUGE growth opportunity. Work from home in your pajamas, make your own hours.</p>
<p>Totally Weird Los Angeles is the ultimate community for those interested in the weird wonderfulness that is Los Angeles. Featuring a podcast, a blog, and a social media community, TWLA takes all the best aspects of Hidden Los Angeles, Atlas Obscura, and Huel Hower’s California’s Gold and rolls them into one irreverent, oddball community full of love and respect for all things uniquely Angeleno. With a point of view that is decidedly pro female and pro intersectional, we seek to tell the stories of those who are historically less heard. We most definitely cover topics you are familiar with, but we can guarantee you that you’ve never heard things quite this way. TWLA covers everything that makes LA what it is. The community has something for everyone, from recent transplants, to multigenerational natives, and to those far and wide fascinated with the mythos of our great city.</p>
