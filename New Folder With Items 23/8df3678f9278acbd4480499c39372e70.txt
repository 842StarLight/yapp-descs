<h2>Account & People Manager @ 43North Startup</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>Ready to get the startup experience? Are you a kind, passionate person? We're looking for motivated people-people to be part of a small, growing team.</p>
<p>HiOperator is a next-gen customer service platform, combining integrations, AI, and awesome people. Working at HiOperator can be hard and challenging, but we also provide as much opportunity for rapid growth as possible.</p>
<p>Customer service can be a grind sometimes - but it's a challenge that the entire team at HiOperator - from our agents to our engineers to our CEO - embraces.</p>
<p>This position is a hybrid role between operations and account management. You should be comfortable (and willing to get your hands dirty!) with customer service basics, but also comfortable managing client relationships. We're specifically looking for a demonstrated track record of successful client management.</p>
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE that you must be willing to work at least one weekend day/night and some evenings/week. </b></p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>What you’ll do:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of the day, your job is to ensure client happiness. While you have layers of support and a team working with you to help make the magic happen, you are ultimately responsible for the setting and meeting expectations with the client.</li>
<li>This includes reporting to and communicating with clients on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. We expect you to be the in-house expert on your clients and their processes and be hands-on and directly involved with their tickets.</li>
<li>You'll also be quite involved on the operational side in terms of staffing and training for your specific clients.</li>
<li>You will be responsible for supervising employees working during your Floor Manager shifts.</li>
</ul>
<p>About you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependable – Will show up ready to roll everyday with a positive attitude and creative mindset.</li>
<li>Tech Savvy &amp; Quick Learner - We don't expect you to write code, but we expect you to learn the ins and outs of our in-house systems as well as common client systems.</li>
<li>Experience with Account Management - great instincts and experience on how to manage client accounts and turn situations around.</li>
<li>Self Starter &amp; Team Player – We’re a small startup and things can be ambiguous and chaotic at times. You’ll take the initiative to be strategic and understand the importance of interaction while having an awesome attitude and the ability to hustle. We're looking for people who exceed minimum expectations.</li>
<li>Willingness to be flexible – You cover for someone, they cover for you, in all things</li>
<li>Must be willing to work some weekends and evenings. Customer service runs 365 days a year and so holiday flexibility is also required.</li>
<li>Must be willing to provide phone support if needed</li>
</ul>
<p>More about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfort using Google Suite of Products</li>
<li>Experience using customer service software is a plus: i.e. ZenDesk, FreshDesk, Shopify, Magento</li>
<li>Excellent written and verbal skills - comfortable on phones</li>
<li>12+ Months in an account management role</li>
