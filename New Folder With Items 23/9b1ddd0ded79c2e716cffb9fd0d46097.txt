The Opportunity</b></h1>
<p>BrandActive continues to grow and expand our business. As a result, we have an immediate opening for a Small and Medium Sized Business (SMB) Territory Business Development Manager who will focus on a new area of business in the US North East region and Eastern Canada. This is a great opportunity to leverage BrandActive’s extensive experience with a non-competitive offering, while working with a very dynamic and experienced team in a full-time permanent role.</p>
<p>
BrandActive has developed a new offering that leverages our core rebrand implementation methodology and service offering, to provide an on-line toolkit and consulting solution at an affordable price for the small to medium sized enterprise ($100M-$600M in revenue and/or 500+ employees). This offering provides the best of our 20+ years of intellectual property, our resources, and our Rebrand Analytics Engine (RAE) for organizations that aren’t big enough for our core offering who need systems, a roadmap, tools, and templates to lead them through the process, and who can take on much of the heavy lifting internally.</p>
<p>
We are looking for a curious, energetic, entrepreneurial individual, who wants to really know, own, and build a market with this new business offering. The right individual will explore the market in a consultative way to identify opportunities for this new offering as well as our core offering in those SMB organizations within their market which may need our services at any level. You must be an experienced professional willing to challenge yourself by creating new business opportunities. This position will require travel throughout this region as well as periodic travel to Toronto, Canada; Denver; and New York for strategic meetings.</p>
<p>
We are all committed to working together to achieve our North Star of a team of great people, doing great work and having a great time doing it. As part of this, there is an expectation that all of our team members will contribute to internal initiatives that advance our client and/or team member experience while challenging us to be smarter, faster, better in everything that we do! We find that this allows us to be agile in our approach to the work and provide growth opportunities for our team members.</p>
