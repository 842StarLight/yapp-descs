<br><br>
EquipmentShare is searching for a Senior Customer Strategy Consultant who can create and drive clear, compelling value propositions that specifically address our target large clients' challenges and articulates how EquipmentShare's solutions solve those problems financially and operationally. Think customer-engaging, smart, creative consultant that is a critical team member working with sales, business development, customer business case contacts and our own corporate analyst team to provide compelling value propositions that win over our largest clients! This role will work directly with the Chief Revenue Officer as well as major account teams on a daily basis.
<br><br>
EquipmentShare is a full-service construction technology provider. Our platform of solutions includes equipment rentals, sales, and service, as well as technology offerings that create a more productive and connected construction industry. EquipmentShare's Construction Internet of Things (CIoT) telematics solution, Track, enables a modern equipment rental and purchase experience for commercial construction customers. Track is a game-changing differentiator for EquipmentShare and our clients. In addition to construction asset tracking technology, EquipmentShare also offers truck fleets, connected vehicle cameras, hardware security solutions and more to help contractors get more done.
<br><br>
So far in 2019, EquipmentShare has opened 11 construction yards and now covers more than 30 markets across the nation. We've welcomed more than 200 new employees to better serve contractors everywhere. Our team wants to transform the norm of the construction industry, which is, by the way, an industry with an estimated value of $12.7 trillion come 2020.
<br><br>
As we continue to scale our product offerings, services and markets, we're looking for a Senior Customer Strategy Consultant to work directly with large enterprise-level accounts to create compelling Construction IoT technology value propositions, strong rental propositions, and leverage our creative insurance, financing, and equipment sharing offers that ensure our end-users have a positive experience every step of the way.
<br><br>
So, What is EquipmentShare?
<br>---------------------------
<br><br>
While running their construction companies, brothers Willy and Jabbok Schlacks were frustrated with the options they had for renting equipment. With more than 40 years of combined construction experience, they decided it was time to do things differently and build something, for once, for contractors.
<br><br>
The brothers originally founded EquipmentShare as a peer-to-peer rental platform at Startup Weekend in Columbia, Missouri, in 2014 and proceeded to catapult their vision to market when they applied and were accepted into Y Combinator's accelerator program ( https://www.ycombinator.com/ ) in Mountain View, California, in 2015.
<br><br>
In just four years, EquipmentShare has evolved greatly as a business and expanded across the U.S. with our brick-and-mortar rental locations and we've captured customers in nearly every state with our cloud-connected telematics platform Track ( https://equipmentshare.com/track ). EquipmentShare today continues the mission of fostering innovation in the dated construction industry.
<br><br>
