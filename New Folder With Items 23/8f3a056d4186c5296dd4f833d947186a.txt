<li>Provide frequent verbal and written updates to senior leadership on strategic plans, risk and opportunity assessments, and performance evaluation of key pricing initiatives.
</li>
<li>Develop action plans, including but not limited to systems, reports, processes and analytical approaches to address major pricing opportunities and coordinate the execution of these action plans across the various pertinent functional areas.
</li>
<li>Collaborate with the analytics team to develop a consistent approach to measure the net revenue impact of commercial initiatives and the incremental contribution of intermediaries and distribution channels.
</li>
<li>Organize and facilitate periodic cross-functional reviews on the efficacy of the pricing strategy for each brand and geographic area (market).
</li>
<li>Provide mentorship as a subject matter authority supporting cross-functional initiatives of other disciplines.
</li>
<li>Lead work streams across functions to deliver the reporting, tools, processes, and analytical consistency that supports the pricing decision-making.
