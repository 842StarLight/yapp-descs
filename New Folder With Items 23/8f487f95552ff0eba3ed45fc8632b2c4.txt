<p>Director of Software Development</p>
<p>Power is seeking a Director of Software Development to join the team at our headquarters, just outside of Philadelphia, PA. Reporting to the VP of Business Technology, you will have the opportunity to work with talented people on challenging problems and make a significant impact on the business and industry. We believe deeply in what we do: to build something lasting, sustainable and positive.
</p>
<p>You will be responsible for the success of a growing group of software developers on several Scrum teams. Your background as a software developer will earn you credibility with direct reports as you assist in clearing technical impediments that are escalated by Scrum Masters and create opportunities to give critical feedback. Using your inter- personal skills to build relationships with talented software developers is also a key part of the role as you represent the company at technical events and job fairs, interview candidates, and ensure their successful start as a member of a Scrum team.
</p>
<p>What we do here
</p>
<p>At Power, our technology team builds a custom suite of products that run our entire business. We create and deploy complete solutions for marketing, sales, operations, finance, and more. We even have a custom communications platform that connects everyone in the company. We use cutting edge technologies like augmented reality, computer vision, machine learning, speech recognition and processing, geospatial data, and a variety of mobile platforms.
</p>
<p>We enjoy all the benefits of a startup to move fast, ship rapidly and iterate quickly, but within an established organization that is well-funded and profitable. We get to dip our toes in many different, fascinating areas and solve unique, challenging problems that could on their own be standalone apps or companies. We’re a tech powerhouse hidden inside a remodeling company.
</p>
<p>We value diversity of all types at Power and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.
