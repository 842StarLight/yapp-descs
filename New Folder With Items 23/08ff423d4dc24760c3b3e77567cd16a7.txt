<b>Who we're looking for:</b><br>
Starry is seeking a detail-oriented Solutions Engineer for Network Deployment.

<li>Provide expert guidance on Starry system design concepts, including physical network design and key RF considerations</li>
<li>Strong competency in generating solution documentation for both internal stakeholders and clients: often in the form of network implementation plans, physical network designs, slides, documents, and spreadsheets</li>
<li>Ensure the feasibility of your proposed solution with our Deployment and Engineering teams</li>
<li>Track, prioritize, and manage all technical activities and milestones from pre-sale to customer-ready</li>
<li>You'll be the primary point of contact to resolve technical design issues from customers (internal and external) during and after installations</li>
<li>Provide hands-on management of the most complex projects: leading by personally taking on any difficult problems</li>
<li>Beyond day-to-day responsibilities, you'll also develop creative approaches to keep operational costs low and improve the efficiency of our approach to infrastructure deployment</li>
