<h2>Solutions Engineer</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Nauto is an AI technology company that's improving the safety of commercial fleets today and the autonomous fleets of tomorrow. Nauto's intelligent driver safety system assesses how drivers interact with the vehicle and the road ahead to reduce distracted driving and prevent collisions. With this knowledge, Nauto is powering the development of self-driving technology that brings the best of human driving to autonomy. Are you ready to help with this mission?
<br><br>
<b>We're aiming for greater safety and knowledge:</b> Our approach to re-thinking road safety is two-fold: deepen our understanding of real-world drivers to learn how they interact with the vehicle and the road, with the goal of reducing distracted driving and preventing collisions before they occur. Second, apply these insights to the development of safe, effective autonomous vehicles that fit into existing traffic patterns and human driving behavior.
<br><br>
<b>We're taking a driver-centric approach:</b> We surface the safety insights that matter most while protecting the privacy of drivers. By using artificial intelligence on the device, we're able to detect distractions and immediately warn drivers in real-time. Only a fraction of driving time—such as distractions or other high-risk events—is uploaded to the cloud, where it's automatically visible to fleet managers via a secure web application so they can then better coach drivers.
<br><br>
Nauto is backed by SoftBank Vision FundGroup Corp., Greylock Partners, BMW iVentures, General Motors Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures, Allianz Group, Playground Global and DNX Ventures.
