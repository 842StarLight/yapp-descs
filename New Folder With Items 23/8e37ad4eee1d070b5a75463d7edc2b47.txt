<h2>Account Executive</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">An Inc. 5000 company, ZoomInfo has experienced record year over year growth both in revenues and in numbers of employees in all departments. A large part of this success can be attributed to our amazing team! This growth and continued success led to ZoomInfo's announcement on 4 February 2019 that it had been acquired by DiscoverOrg. Our joint mission is to be the place where every B2B professional responsible for leads, revenue, recruitment, and operations leverages us every single day to execute on their jobs.
<br><br>
Account Executives at ZoomInfo take a consultative approach, partner with &amp; build a trusted rapport with our prospects and clients, by helping them identify their challenges and demonstrating how our products can be a strategic solution for their needs.
<br><br>
Our team takes a multi-tier approach to bringing on new clients. Account Executives are supported by a solid qualified inbound lead pool. They partner with a Business Development Representative to help them infiltrate target accounts, but also create their own key opportunities through prospecting.
<br><br>
The majority of new business is created over phone meetings and web demonstrations. However, a willingness to travel occasionally for onsite meetings is preferred. The ideal candidate is able to understand and analyze a prospect's challenges, and can formulate and present a strategic plan to address their specific needs. Evaluations often include a trial of the appropriate products, consultative data analysis plans and ROI presentations.
<br><br>
ZoomInfo clients range from the majority of the F500 across the mid-market companies to smaller high growth stage businesses.
