<ul><li>*Swit Intro</li></ul>
<p>*Website - https://swit.io<br>Swit is a team collaboration suite that has seamlessly combined a cutting-edge team communication with a high-performance task management.</p>
<ul><li>Why Now?</li></ul>
<p><b><i>92% of people</i></b>have to use <b><i>multiple</i></b>apps <b><i>within</i></b>their company and there is <b><i>no company wide</i></b>team collaboration app available yet! So we have seamlessly combined two biggest components of team collaboration - Messenger and task management.<br>With Swit, users don't have to <b><i>go back and forth</i></b>between the two platforms any longer. People say once they switch tabs or apps, it takes in average 23 minutes to re-focus on their work. Finally, people can move to <b><i>different workflows without losing context</i></b>.</p>
<ul><li>Background</li></ul>
<p>We used <b><i>to be heavy</i></b>users of Slack. Our team used it for more than 5 years and integrated multiple apps in it like Asana or monday.com. separated from G Suite or Office 365. But <b><i>all we could do</i></b>with those integrations was just to receive text-based notifications into selected channels.<br>Also, there are too many overlapped features with no interaction among the integrated products. So, we realized this <b><i>disjoint multi-app environment</i></b>reduced our team productivity and created more <b><i>communication overhead</i></b>. So, we started to build Swit.</p>
<ul><li>Competitive Advantages</li></ul>
<p>1. Functionality - Our primary purpose is to give today’s professionals <b><i>more freedom from too many integrations or app hopping</i></b>through Chat, post, file sharing, various task managements, and still emails.<br>2. Workflow - We wanted to build <b><i>one service for all teams</i></b>. Agile methodology for software developers is not agile for digital marketers or sales reps. That’s why Jira cannot be adopted for entire employees.<br>3. Born for Enterprises - We wanted to build <b><i>the first service for enterprises</i></b>. Existing team collaboration tools were designed for <b><i>small-sized single teams only,</i></b>however, enterprises have a number of teams, which means they need cross-team collaboration and management features. Our Premium tier, which will be available on September, would be the one and only collaboration service that meets these types of need.</p>
<ul><li>What you will be doing</li></ul>
