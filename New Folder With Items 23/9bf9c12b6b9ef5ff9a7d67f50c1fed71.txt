<h2>Account Executive</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">We founded Patch on the belief that healthcare benefits should be simple to use and easy to understand. After personal frustrations (on the phone with insurance companies for hours), we saw the system was causing misery where it didn't need to. Given most Americans don't have $1K to their name, we realized people choose their healthcare based on what their insurance will cover. With over $350B is spent each year on administration in healthcare, this is an important problem that fantastic software and efficient processes can solve.
<br><br>
Patch demystifies health insurance and payment processes so that using benefits and paying for healthcare is a breeze. Patch's revolutionary platform allows doctors to easily check what patients are eligible for, let them know what they owe, and transact instantly, all without having call insurance companies or submit paper claims. This unlocks a better care experience for patients and a faster and cheaper administrative process for providers.
<br><br>
We are a fast moving, mission-driven startup dedicating to solving major problems with healthcare finance. Want to help us make a difference?
