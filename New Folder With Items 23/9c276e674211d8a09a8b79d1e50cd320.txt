<div>We are investing in making Instagram an essential platform for businesses and brands. Marketers and people have shown interest in doing more on Instagram, whether learning about a new brand, shopping for products or downloading a mobile app. Since opening up our platform to self-serve advertising in markets around the world, introducing new ad formats and objectives to deliver performance, and building native organic tools for businesses of any size to take advantage of, we have seen over 2 million monthly advertisers come to Instagram and 25 million business profiles proliferate in our community.
