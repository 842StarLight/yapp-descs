<h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>Overview<br>
</b></h2>
<div></div>
<div><div><div>
<div>C&amp;F Bank is recognized as one of the premier community banks in the country serving Virginians since 1927, and we are looking for highly energetic, service oriented, and customer focused team members to join our growing C&amp;F Bank Family.</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>
As a Service Representative, you will devote much of your day to building long term relationships with our customers, in person and by phone. You will deepen the understanding of our customers' financial needs and provide suggestions. While most of the job is performed in the branches, Service Representatives reach out into the community by placing outbound phone calls to existing clients, visiting businesses, conducting educational seminars, and being active in the community.</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>
In a typical banking day, you will enjoy a high level of customer contact, and you'll draw upon your own product knowledge, cash handling experience, and service training. You will make a difference by assessing a client’s financial needs and delivering first-rate service to help them reach their goals. Every day will be different. You will spend some time on the teller line, at a sales and service desk, and promoting C&amp;F Bank in the surrounding community.</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>
If you are looking for the prestige, security and room for growth offered by a large company, but want the warmth of a neighborhood bank, where you'll know customers by name, and work in a team-oriented environment than C&amp;F Bank is the place for you.</div>
