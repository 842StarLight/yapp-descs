<p><b>FAQ:</b></p>
<p><b>
Applying for a Position at European Wax Center</b></p>
<p>
Q. Can I apply for multiple positions?</p>
<p>
A. Yes, you can apply for multiple positions that interest you. Please read through the job descriptions to ensure the position matches your skillset and desired career path.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
Q. Do I need to have an esthetics or cosmetology license to apply?</p>
<p>
A. While it is not necessary to have physically obtained your license, we do require all of our Wax Specialists to have a current esthetics or cosmetology license (esthetics strongly preferred). We can continue the interview process as long as you have a test date set up to take your state boards and you will have proof of passing the test before the first day of training. All other positions besides Wax Specialists do not require any license.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
Q. Can I drop off my resume in person?</p>
<p>
A. No. Providing your resume in person will not count as an application. Submitting your resume through our career website or another job site is the only way to apply for a position.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
Q. Which location is this for?</p>
<p>
A. Some of our job posting purposefully do not have a specific location listed. Our Chicago city Wax Specialist and management positions are listed as Northern Illinois and the correct location fit based on our hiring needs will be determined in the phone screening stage of the interview process.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><b>
Once You Have Applied</b></p>
<p>
Q. I have submitted my application. What do I do next?</p>
<p>
A. Thank you for applying! You will receive an email survey asking you to answer a few short questions. If your qualifications match the position, you will be contacted by our Human Resources Coordinator.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
Q. Will I be notified if the position I applied for has been filled?</p>
<p>
A. Unfortunately due to the high volume of applications, we are unable to contact every applicant who is not selected for the position.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><b>
The Interview Process</b></p>
<p>
Q. What are the steps of the interview process?</p>
<p>
A. For most positions, we have a 3 step interview process which includes a phone interview, in person interview, and final interview. For some positions there may be extra steps in the interview process (i.e. practical interviews for Wax Specialist candidates).</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
Q. I applied for Guest Service Associate. Can I transition to a Wax Specialist?</p>
<p>
A. Yes, we love to see our associates growing with the company! Once hired, we require all associates to commit to at least 6 months in the Guest Service Associate position. Once a replacement has been found to cover your desk shifts, you will need to reapply for Wax Specialist and go through the entire interview process again. You will need to maintain strong numbers as a Guest Service Associate before being considered for our Wax Specialist position.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
Q. Do you have any interview tips for me?</p>
<p>
A. Yes! Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do your research on European Wax Center. Be able to connect with our mission and have answers at the ready for why you want to work for our company specifically.</li>
<li>The first step will always begin with a phone interview. Please make sure to have a quiet space with no background noise and establish a secure phone connection to prevent distraction throughout the phone interview.</li>
<li>Dress professionally</li>
<li>Be on time for your in person interviews (early is even better!)</li>
<li>Be yourself! We're excited to learn more about you and what you can bring to the EWC team!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
Q. Who should I contact if I have questions about the interview process?</p>
