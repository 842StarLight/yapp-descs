<p><i>News Flash: on the surface, how could something like ‘governance’ or ‘compliance’ in an industry such as the one</i><i> Galvanize </i><i>plays in just can’t be all that sexy, right? The industry seems irrelevant to your daily life — you wouldn’t touch them as a consumer — so why work here? It’ll take a bit to explain, but trust us, it’s worth it. Here are a few good reasons…</i><br>

<b>We are helping to change the world for the better</b><br>
Our Customer Success team is lucky enough to work with some of the largest brands in the world. And we are helping them to make our world a safer, happier and more ethical place. Our software has helped a federal agency track down missing children, help companies avoid vendors that use child labour, and even help banks find patterns that suggest terrorists, drug dealers or other criminals. Talk about having an impact!<br>

<br>
Our Customer Success team is made up of pros with a wide variety of skills - from consultants with in-depth industry experience, to Customer Intensity Specialists that make it their mission to ensure our clients are successful.
