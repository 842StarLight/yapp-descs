Who we are:</b></p>
<p>
MyCase was founded by a practicing lawyer and a team of technology experts to address one of the most pressing problems in the legal industry - a lack of secure and efficient attorney/client communication. Appfolio then acquired MyCase in 2012. Coupling the financial backing of a successful software company with the founding team’s deep knowledge of the legal space, MyCase has quickly become a leading provider of online practice management software and is growing exponentially!</p>
