<p><b>Who We Are:</b></p>
<p>AwardSpring is an established and fast-growing Software as a Service (SaaS) start-up that partners with colleges and foundations to help them award scholarships and grants. We want to make it as easy as possible for students to apply for and receive scholarship money, and as easy as possible for institutions to deliver that money and raise more money for future students.</p>
<p><b>Our Values:</b></p>
<p><i>Bias for Action: </i>We are a small team that is in full growth mode at the moment. We all wear a lot of hats (figuratively) and we have a deep appreciation for showing ownership and accountability to our peers and customers (literally).
</p>
<p><i>Find A Way: </i>We have found that there is not always an easy answer to every question or issue that arises. Yet, we strive to be creative and find a way to simplify things every day. Together, we find a way to remove every roadblock.</p>
<p><i>Be Human:</i> After all, we are all people (robots – please do not apply). We like to have a human voice and show empathy and friendliness to everyone we interact with.</p>
<p><i>Keep Improving:</i> We accept that we are not perfect, but we strive to get a little bit better every day. Hopefully you do too.</p>
<p><b>Who You Are:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You are <i>not too far removed from the world of college</i> and scholarships and understand the critical need for a simplified and streamlined scholarship application and award process.</li>
<li>
You want to <i>jump start your career</i> through enterprise sales and business development.</li>
<li>
You have somewhere between <i>0-2 years of experience</i> working while in college or after college.</li>
<li>
You are <i>coachable</i>: You are not expected to come here and have all the answers. We will train and coach you and put you in a position to succeed. We just need you to be open to trying new (and potentially uncomfortable at first) things and we will coach you along the way.</li>
<li>
You have <i>passion/grit</i>: You approach achievement as a marathon. You have the grit and stamina to continue when the going gets tough and you face rejection. You understand that your work is helping your customers solve for pain in their daily lives and that is something you are passionate about.</li>
<li>
You have an <i>abundance of natural curiosity</i>: Perhaps you were one of those kids that asked “why?” over and over again until your parents went crazy. Perhaps you asked questions that were a bit more well-formed. Either way, you are an intellectually curious life-long learner who cherishes the process of figuring things out.</li>
<li>
You are a <i>compassionate competitor</i>: You want to win, but not at the expense of your team. There may be no “I” in “team”, but you understand that your individual performance is important, and you will compete to be a top contributor to the overall team's success.</li>
</ul>
