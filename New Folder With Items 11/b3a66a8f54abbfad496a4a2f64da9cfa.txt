<div>
<div>Disrupt the media industry status quo by joining our hyperlocal monthly print publication.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div>Yes, we pride ourselves on being a print-first media outlet, and our success proves we are influencing the future of news.</div>
<div>
<br>
<i>Community Impact Newspaper</i> delivers 31 hyperlocal editions to more than <b>2.6 million homes</b> throughout the Austin, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix and now Nashville areas. Each of the markets we serve has its own dedicated editorial, sales and design staff, just like a small, traditional community newspaper.</div>
<div>
<br>
But we're not small at all. We are a 230-person news enterprise that produces it own product – our printing plant opened in 2016. Editorial teams get their own Apple laptops, digital camera and other resources that only a growing newspaper company could provide.</div>
<div>Why are we so successful? We believe most people don't want right- or left-leaning news – just the news, and preferably from their own backyard. Since 2005, we have provided local, useful news without any ulterior motive or agenda.</div>
<div>
<br>
Reader feedback and independent surveys prove our readers appreciate this dedication to truth-telling. Come work here and find out for yourself.</div>
