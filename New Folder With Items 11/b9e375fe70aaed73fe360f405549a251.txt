Valero Texas Open Overview:</b></div>

The Valero Texas Open (VTO) is one of 46 events that make up the world’s leading professional golf circuit, the PGA TOUR. The VTO is the 3rd oldest event on the PGA TOUR, dating back to 1922.

The VTO has raised over $153 million for charity and is one of top three on the PGA TOUR in annual charity donations - with $15 million donated in 2019.</div>

Each year the VTO attracts 144 of the top PGA TOUR professionals, tens of thousands of spectators each day, millions of television viewers and a list of blue-chip sponsors to TPC San Antonio and the JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort &amp; Spa in an effort to raise significant funds for charities throughout the South Texas community and beyond.</div>
