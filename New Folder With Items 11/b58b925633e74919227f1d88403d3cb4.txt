We are motivated by three fundamental global challenges that face us today as we approach 8 billion people on earth: generating much broader access to food, energy and health care. Berkeley Lights has invented a platform technology that provides a rapid and predictable way to assess the function of living cells/organisms. With our technology, analysis and biology feedback are not only rapidly obtained at a fraction of the cost, but more importantly our customers find the specific biology that works the way they want it to work. This means predictable results in less time, for less money, and the ability to discover therapeutics or to find and engineer organisms that produce fuels, food, medicines, or clothing locally; anywhere in the world. Essentially, our technology enables the deployment of biology to the solve the largest problems that we face globally. This means everyone can have access to food, therapies, clothing, and energy which will drive strong global economic growth. We are looking for leadership team members with experience at scaling organizations to enable rapid and responsible growth over the very long-term.</div>
