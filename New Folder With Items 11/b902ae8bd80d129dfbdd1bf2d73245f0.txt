<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
You know our competitors like the back of your hand: what they do today and what they plan to do in</div>
<div>
the future. You also know our buyers better than they know themselves, including how they make</div>
<div>
their buying decisions. This isn’t guesswork. You back up strategic insights with market evidence</div>
<div>
and then use that knowledge to drive the development of positioning and messaging that resonates</div>
<div>
with buyers and empowers our sales channels to be successful.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
You will collaborate with our marketing team to develop innovative programs that drive demand.</div>
<div>
Attention to detail and eye for quality are critical to your success, along with an ability to grasp and</div>
<div>
present our product’s value proposition in a way that resonates and clearly articulates how we solve</div>

our buyers’ problems. You are obsessed with tracking performance and have the data to prove</div>
<div>
what’s working and what isn’t.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
In addition to the marketing team, you will regularly collaborate with product managers and sales</div>
<div>
channels; it’s a balancing act that requires strong diplomatic skills, including knowing when to push</div>
<div>
back and when to dive in.</div>
