<p>
Involved. Innovative. Enthusiastic. These are just a few words that describe the Umpqua customer experience associate.</p>
<p>
If you believe customer service begins with exceeding (not simply meeting) customer expectations, and you have a knack for picking up on the little clues that allow you to fulfill the customer's needs before they realize they even have the need, and you truly love your community and believe that being a teller does not stop at the front door of your bank, then this is the job for you. The right candidate does things that garner compliments on the thoughtful, unexpected ways she celebrates and recognizes others. He embraces change as an essential function of growth. The opportunity to learn excites them. And they seek out opportunities to improve everything they touch.</p>

About Us</b></p>
<p>
We do things a little differently here at Umpqua. Our retail stores serve as community hubs, our associates are given up to 40 hours of volunteer time each year, and we're never satisfied with the status quo. It's no wonder we've made "Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For" eight years in a row. But greatness has no finish line, so we continue every day to keep people at the center of everything we do. We focus on building relationships, understanding our customers' needs and connecting to people in new and innovative ways - always staying true to our mission of providing personalized banking for all people, whenever and however they prefer to bank.</p>
