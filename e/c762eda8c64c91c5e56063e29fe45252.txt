About Imagine Children's Museum: Free and guided play builds a child’s social and academic development. At Imagine Children’s Museum, we promote the power of play: learning and growing by doing what every child loves to do best…play! Our interactive exhibits and activities encourage children chronologically (ages 1-12) and their families to role play, experiment, splash, think, wander and create together in a place where they can feel physically and emotionally safe. Every child and family deserves playtime together at Imagine. Free admission nights and discounted memberships are a few ways we work to ensure that all families have an opportunity to share in the fun. We strive to enrich our community by serving as a resource for schools, family service organizations and other local nonprofits that share the common goal of making children’s lives better.
