<h2>Director of Product Management, Hardware</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">OPSWAT is a global cybersecurity leader that helps protect the worldâ€™s critical infrastructure. Because any file or device coming into any organization could contain malware, introduce vulnerabilities, or be non-compliant, we do not trust any file coming into any organization. We have distilled this Zero Trust philosophy down into two simple sentences: Trust no File. Trust no Device. All of our products and technologies spring from this philosophy.
<br><br>
Our platforms enable organizations to implement processes that ensure the secure transfer of files and devices to and from critical networks. OPSWAT provides these processes to over 1,000 organizations worldwide, in sectors such as Financial Services, Defense, Manufacturing, Energy, Aerospace, Transportation Systems. Most North American nuclear power plants use our processes to secure their facilities. These customers have entrusted us to help them ensure the security of their organizations (and in some cases their countries); ensure compliance with internal policies and governmental regulations; and protect their reputations, their financial standing, and their relationships.
