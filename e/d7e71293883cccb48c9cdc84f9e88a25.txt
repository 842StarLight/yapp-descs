<b>Penn Station East Coast Subs:</b> Assistant Manager
<br><br>
People don?t aspire to work their way up the ladder in the restaurant business to achieve an Assistant Manager level then get stuck.
<br><br>
The goal is to run your own store!
<br><br>
6 out of 9 of the General Managers in our company were promoted from the Assistant Manager position. And all of them were promoted within 12-18 months. So as I am advertising for an Assistant Manager position, I am not really looking for an Assistant Manager as much as our next General Manager. That being said our Assistant Managers have the following benefits.
<br><br>
50 Hour Work Week
<br><br>
$30k ? $35k Potential
<br><br>
Health Insurance Offered
<br><br>
Closed on Easter, 4th of July, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and we close early on New Year?s Eve and after lunch on Christmas Eve.
<br><br>
Typically a Saturday or Sunday off each week.
<br><br>
Manage a Staff of 10-15 employees.
<br><br>
Profit Sharing ? No pie in the sky bonus.
<br><br>
When you achieve the General Manager level you will have the following incentives
<br><br>
$40k - $70k Salary Potential
<br><br>
55 Hour minimum work week
<br><br>
Paid Vacation
<br><br>
Typically most nights and Saturday or Sunday off
<br><br>
And I can?t stress enough? PROFIT SHARING! The more profit you bring to the table the more money you make!
