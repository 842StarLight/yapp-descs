</div>
<div>Yes, we are seeking Store Managers, but don’t be fooled by the word “manager”. Truth is, the rest of the world is just more familiar with the word. And while managing is part of the job, we’re really looking for leaders. Leaders who can drive profitability by maximizing sales. Leaders who can also shape the store according to our shared values, standards, policies and procedures along with the District Team. And sometimes, these leaders will take on multiple roles such as the manager on duty or department manager or symbolic leader on the floor. You know, being whatever is necessary at any given moment so our customers can find what’s possible for their personal style, and our team members can find what’s possible for their careers.</div>
