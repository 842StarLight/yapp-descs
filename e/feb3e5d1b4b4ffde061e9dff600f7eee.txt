Our software now helps solve problems like these for businesses in 55 countries across the globe, improving operations and employee management for restaurants, retail, entertainment, and dozens of other industries. We’ve helped hourly employees complete over 1 billion tasks, and we’re only looking to improve that trajectory from here.
