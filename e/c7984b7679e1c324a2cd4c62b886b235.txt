About JazzHR:</b></p>
<p>
Since 2009, JazzHR has raised the bar in the recruiting software industry, with many of our innovations becoming industry-standard. We’re the first company to put powerful, yet easy-to-use recruiting software in the hands of startups, growing companies, and even presidential campaigns.</p>
<p>
As JazzHR, we’re now on a mission to reveal the elusive yet absolutely critical connection between recruiting and performance. We’re doing this by creating innovative tools that help companies uncover the hidden recipes for making transformative hires.</p>
<p>
We believe that hiring managers have the most important job during the whole recruiting process (choosing whom to hire), yet they’re the most underserved user of recruiting software. There’s nothing in recruiting software that helps hiring managers make better hires. We’re dedicated to closing the loop that connects recruiting to performance so how a company recruits actually transforms how it performs.</p>
<p>
We’re called JazzHR because we feel it’s a powerful metaphor for the challenges that employees face to perform in today’s modern work environment. It also represents the fact that our software breaks the rules of our industry. Jazz music doesn’t fit into a box. Jazz fans don’t fit in a box. Our company JazzHR certainly doesn’t fit in a box.</p>
<p>
JazzHR has offices in Pittsburgh, PA and Waltham, MA. Our team has been the recipient of a series of prominent awards. Named an Inc. 5000 company in 2017 for the second consecutive year, JazzHR continues to be recognized for its accelerated growth and human capital management solutions. Along with being named 2017's Best Human Capital - Talent Management Solution in the 32nd annual SIIA CODiE Awards, JazzHR was recently ranked the No. 1 most user-friendly Applicant Tracking Software by Capterra.</p>
<p>
JazzHR is an equal opportunity employer. All employment decisions are solely based on business needs, job requirements and individual qualifications without regard to race, gender, religion, ethnicity, age or any other status protected by the laws and regulations where we operate.</p>
