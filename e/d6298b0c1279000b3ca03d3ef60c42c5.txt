<h2>VP of Sales, North America</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">DISCO was initially developed at a litigation boutique in Houston. It was born in 2013 out of the firm’s frustration with conventional eDiscovery tools that were slow and difficult for lawyers to use. Instead of being forced to adapt our work methods to technology, we wanted to invent technology that works the way lawyers work. DISCO was the result, and today we are the fastest-growing eDiscovery solution in North America.
<br><br>
We are looking for an experienced sales leader to join DISCO that is excited to help us scale in North America (and beyond). This person will work directly with our CRO and a cross-functional leadership team to set strategy and drive initiatives that enable our field sales team to exceed their revenue targets.

<li>Your teams are constantly looked at as the standard of excellence in the enterprise software sales arena</li>
<li>You understand and have overcome the challenges of growing a team that consistently delivers results in a high-growth environment</li>
<li>You know how to balance agility with building systems and practices required for scale</li>
<li>You have a Bachelors degree (have a Masters or JD? Even better!)</li>
</ul>
What You’ll Do
<br><ul>
<li>You’ll manage a team of 4+ Regional Sales Directors, providing day-to-day leadership and tactical deal structuring</li>
<li>You’ll provide an environment that fosters accountability among the field sales team</li>
<li>You will work directly with the CRO on defining, executing, evaluating, and adjusting an overall sales strategy that exceeds revenue targets</li>
<li>You will partner with Sales Ops and Business Intelligence to gather the data you need to measure progress and make data-driven decisions</li>
<li>You will provide the leadership and coaching to enable both individual and team success</li>
<li>You work closely with sales executives and sales directors on fostering relationships within some of the largest legal firms and companies in the world</li>
</ul>
