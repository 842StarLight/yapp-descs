<p>With six major mountain ranges surrounding the community, three blue ribbon rivers, five golf courses, three world class skiing resorts, 284 mountain trails, Montana State University, and the gateway town to Yellowstone National Park, it's no wonder Bozeman appeared as No. 2 on the top 10 list for bizjournals.com's list of American 'dream towns.' Bozeman High has been ranked on Newsweek's top-schools list five times since 2003. Seventy-four percent of the community's 41,000 residents have some post-secondary education. University graduates, along with industry-experienced newcomers seeking a higher quality of life, provide a brain pool for the area's mix of expanding businesses.</p>
<p>
Because of its access to some of the best ski mountains in the United States, SKI Magazine has ranked Bozeman as the #4 ski town in the country. Powder Magazine ranked Bozeman in the 'top 32 ski towns in North America' and National Geographic, placed Bozeman in the 'World's 25 Best Ski Towns.' In addition, Outside Magazine has ranked Bozeman as the 5th best college town in the United States and ranks the city 15th in the United States for access to outside sports. This active outdoor lifestyle is coupled with a strong work ethic that has enabled Bozeman to rank number one as a business climate among cities under 100,000 in the United States, by American City Business Journals.</p>
<p>
With tons of great cultural events including museums, symphony, opera, and a vibrant live music scene as well as the great outdoors, it isn't what to do in Bozeman, but what not to do because there are so many activities-snow or sunshine. And, if staying around is not enough, we have an international airport with direct flights to 10+ major US cities.</p>
