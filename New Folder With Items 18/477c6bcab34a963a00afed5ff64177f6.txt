<br><br>
Spire Global is a space-to-cloud analytics company that owns and operates the largest multi-purpose constellation of satellites. Its proprietary data and algorithms provide the most advanced maritime, aviation, and weather tracking in the world. In addition to its constellation, Spire's data infrastructure includes a global ground station network and 24/7 operations that provide real-time global coverage of every point on Earth.
<br><br>
In the time it takes you to read this job description our low earth orbit nanosatellites ( https://spire.com/spirepedia/nanosatellites ) would have passed overhead at least three times traveling at around 8km a second. Onboard, the satellites are collecting and downloading radio signals (data) that help drive value across the Maritime, Weather and Aviation industries.
<br><br>
Since Spire's first launch in 2013, we've put up more than 100 satellites, each batch better than the previous one (at the time of this writing, we are on our 18th iteration). Our satellites have three payloads: Our AIS data receiver, our GNSS/GPS radio occultation receiver, and our ADS-B aircraft signal receiver. The Spire Marketing team is focused on taking that data and impacting the world in positive ways, come join us!
