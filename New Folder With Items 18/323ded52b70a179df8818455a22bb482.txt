The Opportunity
<br><br>
While Worldpay is a rapidly growing company, keeping a personal face with our clients and partners is an important piece of that sustained growth. Our Service Management teams are tasked with keeping close, positive relationships with our contacts outside the company to ensure their every need is met. By being a friendly and receptive point of contact, our clients can trust they're in the right hands at Worldpay.
<br><br>
The Service Manager has the important task of overseeing enterprise-level support and service. They know the ins and outs of Worldpay's catalog of products and services in order to provide informed and accurate support to our best clients and customers. A key player in maintaining long-lasting relationships with our customers, he/she assures Worldpay's continued growth.
<br><br>
