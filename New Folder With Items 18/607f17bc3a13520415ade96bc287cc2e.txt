<p>Andy Mohr Automotive Group is the largest volume car dealership group in the state of Indiana and its roots are humble.</p>
<p>Andy Mohr started selling cars as a summer job between his junior and senior years at Indiana University. After graduation and a short stint in industrial sales, Mohr got back into the car business, but this time … forever.</p>
<p>He worked his way up from a salesman to a finance manager to a sales manager and then to a general manager at several different dealerships. In 1992 he bought the dealership where he was the general manager. Since then he has grown his business to include thirteen dealerships and service centers, three collision centers and one heavy-duty truck center.</p>
<p>Mohr takes the car business seriously and says that hard work and passion have been the secrets to growing the business. Customer satisfaction means everything, whether it’s at the point of sale, on the service drive or in the collision centers.</p>
<p>“We simply treat our customers the way we want to be treated,” states Mohr. “We are committed to being in business for the long term.”</p>
<p>Mohr’s goal is to sell volume. With aggressive advertising campaigns that are value-oriented, car customers are very familiar with the Andy Mohr brand. Andy Mohr dealerships are stocked with large inventories that are priced very competitively.</p>
<p>The Andy Mohr Automotive group employs more than 1100 employees throughout central Indiana and the employees are customer-centric. They are honest and straightforward and get customers in and out efficiently.</p>
<p>“This is a people business and we hire only the best. The best in the industry who can provide great customer satisfaction at the time of the sale and beyond,” Mohr said. “It all starts with customer satisfaction and I only hire good, professional people.”</p>
<p>Mohr is passionate about charity and supports many not-for-profit community organizations in our neighborhoods. Additionally, Mohr is the 2013 Campaign Chairman for the United Way of Central Indiana and is spearheading efforts to raise more than $41-million dollars to benefit our community. He is also a donor to the Indiana University athletic department.</p>
<p>All applications will be kept confidential. Andy Mohr Automotive is an Equal Opportunity Employer and offers 401k, vision and dental insurance, paid time off and salary plus bonus pay.</p>
