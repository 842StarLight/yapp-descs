ABOUT BRODY BROTHERS QUALITY PEST CONTROL</b></p>
<p>
We are a family-owned company of oddballs that has been servicing Baltimore's pest control needs since 1984. We pride ourselves in our good ol' family atmosphere as well as being experts in our field. Everyone from our technicians to office staff is trained in how to answer pest questions. Our office staff, whether they like it or not, are always being sent photos of bugs to identify, and we consider them to be pest detectives just as much as our technicians. We have been Angie's List Super Service Winners for 10 years as well as being named Best of Baltimore winners by the local media.</p>
<p>
We work hard to hire and retain people who don't take themselves too seriously and are as committed to quality customer service as we are. That's why we offer above-average pay for the industry, an excellent benefits package, free jokes not guaranteed to be funny, and a fun work environment. We focus on career growth and like to promote from within. Hey, if we find someone who can put up with our antics, we want them to stick around!</p>

You also get to help prepare for and participate in local events or trade shows. Thanks to your attention to detail, our customer relationship management CRM database and fundraising records are always up-to-date.</p>
<p>
You act as the social media administrator and content creator across all company social media platforms. Whether emails, blog posts, tweets, status updates, photos, or videos, you know how to put together engaging material! Pay-per-click PPC and search engine optimization SEO are tools of your trade.
