Our team is the voice of EnCompass, providing the lens through which our clients and our partners experience EnCompass. The team tells the stories around our solutions and live and breathe our motto of "clients first."</p>

Marketing
</b></p>
<p>Know the client. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at EnCompass starts with technology and ends with the client, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how EnCompass’s solutions solve the world’s problems - from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And, we approach marketing in a way that only EnCompass can - breaking the rules, redefining the medium, making the client the hero and, ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>
<p><b>
Communications
</b></p>
<p>It's our job to help inform and educate clients and partners about the benefits of EnCompass’s solutions and our distinctive company culture/values. We are looking for quick-witted, entrepreneurial and intellectually curious people to join the team. To succeed here, you'll need to be able to combine creativity with the organizational skills to manage numerous different projects to tight deadlines simultaneously, as well as enjoy pitching to all kinds of clients and partners (we find it hard too!). Things happen quickly at EnCompass, and to get stuff done here you need to be an enthusiastic team player - a self-starter who can work cross-functionally and isn't frightened to take risks or try out new ways of doing things.</p>
