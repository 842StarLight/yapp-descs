<p><b>About FMG Suite</b><br>
<br>
FMG Suite started eight years ago and has grown to roughly 200 employees spread across the globe. We pride ourselves on a great work/life balance, healthy team dynamics, high creative standards, and a sense of humor about our place in the marketing software universe.</p>
<p>
We are a SaaS company that creates marketing software–websites, automated email, and social media tools–for the financial services industry. Those tools rely on a steady stream of great content (videos, articles, infographics, interactive pieces, etc) created week in, week out by our in-house Creative Team.</p>
<p>
<b>About the Role</b></p>
<p>
We’re looking for a Copywriter to produce content for small businesses in the financial services and the insurance industry. You’ll be a member of the Creative Team and will report to the Content Director. You will join a small but mighty band of other copywriters, web and graphic designers, subject matter experts, publishers and marketers.</p>
<p>
In a given month, our tight-knit team works on upwards of 150 content pieces across four brands, ranging from weekly economic commentary articles to heartwarming videos about retiring happy. We are thoughtful Design Thinkers who listen well, collaborate happily, inspire each other, and generally don’t take ourselves too seriously.</p>
<p>
In a given day, you might be working on an article on 401(k) rollovers, a video script about early retirement, a sales landing page, an announcement email going out to 40,000 customers, and a whitepaper about life insurance. Ideally, you have experience writing for the financial services industry or a similar compliance-restricted field.</p>
<p>
You’re not afraid of new technology, and you’re excited to collaborate on things like content strategy, design, and customer experience projects. An understanding of digital marketing basics is a major plus.</p>
<p>
Much will be asked of you in this role, but you’ll also be given plenty of opportunities to both sharpen your writing skills, and broaden them. Attention to detail, hyper-flexibility, and a desire to thrive in a fast-paced, dynamic environment are non-negotiable traits.</p>
