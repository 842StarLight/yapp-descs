Our company values are important to us. We thought we would share them with you as someone interested in joining our team.
<br><br>
INNOVATE ALWAYS. Seek out unique perspectives, diverse experiences, and disconnected dots. These are the seeds of big ideas and exceeded expectations, made even better through constant collaboration.
<br>EMBRACE FAILURE. Learn from the inevitable failures that result from innovation, and move forward quickly with a pioneering spirit. Champion the doers, celebrate their contributions to the team, and don't shy away from difficult conversations.
<br>DRIVE THE MISSION FORWARD. Everything we do is through the inclusive lens of helping all business owners launch and grow, regardless of who they are or where they come from. Hold yourself to the highest standards of quality and equality in everything you do.
<br>EVERYONE TAKES OUT THE TRASH. No task is too small for the success of our company or our owners. Always be thoughtful and practice extreme kindness toward our team, partners, and owners.
<br>SIMPLIFY AND COMMIT. Maintain a bias toward efficiency, acting quickly and testing often. Recognize the opportunity cost of every decision, commit to deadlines, be on time, and search for simple, smart solutions.
