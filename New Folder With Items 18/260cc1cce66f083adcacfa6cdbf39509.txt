<b>About Us:</b><br>
Luma Health was founded on the idea that patients should easily be able to connect to their healthcare provider in a way that's modern and mobile-first.

For doctors, it means a full schedule, better patient outcomes, and caring for more patients. For clinics, it means a more automated practice, more revenue, and higher MIPS scores. For patients, it means getting the care they need and experiencing next-level patient care.
