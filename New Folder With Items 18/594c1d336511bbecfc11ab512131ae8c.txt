Level Access helps companies design and enhance their IT systems - including web sites, web applications, software, hardware, and services - so they are usable by people with disabilities. In the same way that buildings must conform to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) modern web sites and applications must be accessible to people with disabilities or face legal liability. Level Access allows organizations to address these risks through software, training, and consulting solutions. This ensures that people with disabilities have equal access to, and use of, IT systems. With over 1000 public and private sector customers Level Access is the leader in the growing field of accessible IT solutions. Level Access's flagship product offering, AMP (Accessibility Management Platform), is the industry's first on-demand solution that integrates the business and technical aspects of complying with regulations such as Section 508, ADA, and WCAG.
