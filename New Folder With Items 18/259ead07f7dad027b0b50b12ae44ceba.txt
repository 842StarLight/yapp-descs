 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p>We are interviewing for Inside Sales Representatives to service the continual flow of new customers.</p>
<p>You will benefit from the millions of dollars we spend annually on direct response, national print, radio, television, and internet advertising, typically generating thousands of new customers yearly.</p>
<p>We offer various in-depth paid training programs to select qualified individuals, and our company provides fully paid premium Blue Cross Medical and dental insurance, along with life and disability coverage after two months.</p>
<p>No prior industry experience required. We provide our award-winning training program complete with materials and specialized instruction from America’s Gold Expert and our President, Dr. Mike Fuljenz, that will provide representatives with the opportunity to gain a distinctive expertise in the precious metals and rare coin industry. With more than 60 national awards to his credit from the Numismatic Literary Guild, American Numismatic Association and Press Club of Southeast Texas for his seminars, books, columns and media appearances on rare coins, precious metals and consumer protection issues, there is no better recognized expert in the region to train you than Dr. Mike Fuljenz. He is the ONLY area dealer that is a listed contributor to the three leading national coin price guides. No other competitor in Texas can legitimately make all these claims.</p>
