<h2>Account Manager</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">In a Nutshell
<br>Valve+Meter is in search of an Account Executive. The Account Executive is responsible for ensuring successful client performance internally and externally. You will lead our day-to-day client relationships and work to achieve all targets identified in client statements of work. This role ensures organizational alignment toward exceeding our projected performance requirements as well as anticipates any potential risks.
<br><br>
Why is this role important for Valve+Meter’s work?
<br>The Account Executive is the bridge between our client strategy and operational excellence. You will serve as our internal client voice, providing strategic direction and identifying programs that can help their book of business win in the market.
<br><br>
What do you do?
<br><ul>
<li>Serve as the primary point of contact for your clients. Own the relationship and provide day to day leadership to an assigned book of business.</li>
<li>Assist in creating the ongoing marketing strategy for your clients based on their growth goals and historical campaign performance.</li>
<li>Manage projects internally for your clients, getting things done yourself and most importantly working with others on the team to get the right things done (on time and on budget)</li>
<li>Facilitate client meetings including: preparing agendas, working through critical challenges, identifying new value added opportunities and performance evaluations.</li>
<li>Advocate for the client to ensure that we’re not just checking off boxes in a task manager, but instead moving them forward and reaching their objectives (focus is on key metrics, such as Return on Marketing Spend, not just project completion).</li>
<li>Identify trends in marketing performance and escalate concerns or opportunities internally.</li>
<li>Represent our core values in each client interaction.</li>
<li>Note: You’re not responsible to bring in new clients (this is not a sales position). You are responsible to keep and grow your clients with exceptional client experience, data-driven recommendations, and strong core values.</li>
<li>Note: Our focus is on lead generation and attributable marketing; while we are tactic agnostic, we will always gravitate to marketing that can be tracked, proven, and scaled. Our marketing projects include SEO, PPC, content marketing, email engagement, web design &amp; development projects.</li>
</ul>
What we’re looking for (for this particular position)
<br><ul>
<li>Ability to provide exceptional client experiences: You are their internal advocate on our team, which means consistent communication and having their best interests at heart.</li>
<li>Strong project management skills: a.k.a. the ability to efficiently and effectively get things done yourself and through other people.</li>
<li>Business and financial acumen: Our campaigns are performance and results-driven. It’s crucial to be able to make data-driven decisions and understand the impact of marketing as a part of a whole business, from sales to operations and beyond.</li>
<li>Executive presence: Our client points of contact are often executive or ownership-level business leaders. It’s important to be able to hold your own and speak at their speed and level.</li>
<li>Account management experience: Our clients are often fast-growing, entrepreneurial organizations; we support challenger brands with a very tailored approach. Not all account management experience is created equal.</li>
<li>Marketing experience: Basic understanding of digital and traditional marketing with an ability to learn &amp; grow, stay on top of current trends, and focus on results</li>
</ul>
Who we’re not looking for (for this position)
<br><ul>
<li>Majority of experience in sales functions that drive sales over results. While our account executives are responsible for surfacing new test opportunities and spearheading client retention, this position is relationship and performance-driven, not sales-driven.</li>
<li>Majority of experience in SaaS or other industry account positions that support 50+ accounts. Our account managers lead strategic relationships with a very hands-on approach, focusing on quality over quantity and an intimate understanding of the uniqueness of each relationship.</li>
</ul>
Requirements
<br><ul>
<li>Minimum of 2 years as an Account Manager (where you were responsible for your clients’ relationship and success)</li>
<li>Minimum of 3 years working inside of an interactive or marketing agency serving external clients</li>
<li>Marketing project experience with proven experience delivering results</li>
<li>Experience presenting to large and small groups at a senior level</li>
<li>A strong focus on the details</li>
</ul>
If you’re a good fit, you probably
<br><ul>
<li>Thrive in a small and growing team</li>
<li>Feel at home with spreadsheets and task management tools</li>
<li>Enjoy reading books and taking courses to grow yourself</li>
<li>Have an entrepreneurial spirit and enjoy finding ways to improve the status quo</li>
<li>Are comfortable with IM tools, email, video calls, and the phone</li>
<li>Genuinely care about clients (people) and not just getting things done</li>
</ul>
