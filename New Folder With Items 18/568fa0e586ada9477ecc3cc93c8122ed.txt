The base salary is $30,000 per year, paid semi-monthly on the 5th and 20th. Base salary increases are obtained through tenure and performance, evaluated at 6 months, 12 months, and every 12-month period thereafter. At each, an employee is eligible for a raise of up to $5,000, dependent on performance. Salary is non-negotiable.

<p><b>
What is a typical work day like for a designer?</b><br>
Every designer is set up with a daily queue, that shows a list of todos that you are expected to complete during your work day, which is 7AM - 4PM. Every todo has a specific time to complete, and your day will be based around completing these todos efficiently and effectively. Designers can work on todos for 5-10 different clients each day, and for a number of different people in the company. Designers can work with Sales Consultants, Project Managers, Marketing Executives, and Content Writers to complete a wide variety of design related projects, so there is an expectation of collaboration and communication between the Designer and the other team member to make sure the project is completed as fast as possible, with the highest quality work that we can provide to our clients.</p>
<p><b>
Is there room for growth?</b><br>
All leadership positions at Madwire are selected from existing Madwire employees. With our team based model and rate of growth as a company, we constantly have opportunity for leadership advancement.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p><b>
What programs do I need to know?</b><br>
The design team works heavily in the Adobe Creative Suite, and designers coming in are expected to have a high level of understanding in Photoshop and Illustrator specifically. InDesign experience is a plus, but not completely necessary. Any other experience in other design related applications and programs are a plus, so please let us know as we take this into consideration during the application process.</p>
<p><b>
Is this a client facing role?</b><br>
</p>
<p>The design team works specifically with Project Managers, Marketing Consultants, Marketing Executives, Developers, and Content Writers, so communication is crucial in order to meet project deadlines and set proper expectations, but no, the design team is not expected to talk with clients at any point in time. Information is passed from the other departments to the design team and then the design team completes the projects and returns the designs to the team member that will then relay that to the client.</p>
