Opportunity</b></p>
<p>
ViiV is seeking a Senior Director for Fostemsavir Marketing to lead development and execution of launch plans for fostemsavir, a first in class agent to treat patients living with HIV who are heavilty treatment experienced. Responsibilities include assessing complexities of the HIV landscape, developing launch strategies, executing plans to achieve brand goals (sales, profit, market share), building launch teams, and exceeding expectations of customer stakeholders. The role will report to the VP of Marketing, ViiV HealthCare US.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>
Background</b></p>
<p>
The US HIV market is a highly complex fusion of medical, socio-economic and demographic dimensions. These forces intersect across physician, payer, pharmacy, patient and policy stakeholder groups in ways unique to HIV. In the USA diagnosis of HIV is hampered by issues of stigma and lack of access to care. Access to care is poor in socio-economically disadvantaged populations (where the disease is most prevalent). Retention in care is also impacted by social and economic factors and varies by region and state. Maintaining patients on therapy is challenged by lack of adherence and some affordability issues. Effective HIV treatment currently consists of daily therapy to ensure virus levels are undetectable; treatment is for life. Recent clinical evidence has shown that when people living with HIV are virally suppressed, transmission rates reduce – a huge public health benefit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
In recent years the ViiV portfolio has been focused on launches of dolutegravir based regimens including TIVICAY, TRIUMEQ, JULUCA and DOVATO. In early 2020, ViiV will launch the first once monthly long acting injectable regimen for patients living with HIV who are virologically suppressed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
However, for a subset of patients living with HIV, their viral load cannot be fully suppressed with existing medications or classes of medications. Many of these patients are therefore susceptible to transmission of virus to others, opportunistic infections or developing AIDS. Fostemsavir is a first in class attachment inhibitor which is being investigated as add-on therapy for patients living with HIV who have not been able to suppress the virus despite multiple lines of antiviral regimens. Anticipated launch will be in Q3 2020. The population appropriate for fostemsavir will be smaller than for most HIV medications but the market potential remains considerable</p>
<p></p>
