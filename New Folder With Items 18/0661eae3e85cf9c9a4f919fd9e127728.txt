<h2>Head of Marketing</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Whisper.ai is building the world's first noise cancelling hearing aid system: it analyzes your audio in real time, automatically filtering out noise and amplifying the sounds you want to hear. Unlike traditional hearing aids, which simply amplify everything in the room, Whisper amplifies the person you're listening to based on millions of audio prints it learns over time so it's able to pick out who you're listening to, even in the noisiest restaurant.
<br><br>
Based in San Francisco, Whisper is lucky to have the support of great investors including Sequoia Capital, First Round Capital, LUX Ventures, and more.
<br><br>
THE ROLE
<br><br>
As Whisper.ai's marketing leader and first full-time marketing hire, you will build Whisper's brand, lead the launch of our first product, and develop and execute a marketing plan across multiple audiences (hearing care professionals and consumers) as well as channels (e.g. PR, clinical marketing, online &amp; offline advertising, automation strategies and techniques, events, key opinion leaders, and customer success). From the very tactical day-to-day to long-term marketing strategy, you'll be responsible for building a new brand and driving awareness of a revolutionary new product and related technologies. This role will work alongside Whisper's Head of Sales to ensure commercial success of our first product by building and managing a fully integrated sales &amp; marketing organization, with fully aligned goals. This role requires someone with excellent tactical judgement and a bias towards bringing innovative premium products to market. Reporting directly to the Chief Operating Officer, this is a rare opportunity to develop the marketing function from scratch and before commercial launch, and support rapid growth at an early-stage, mission-driven company.
<br><br>
