COMPANY DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>
SAP started in 1972 as a team of five colleagues with a desire to do something new. Together, they changed enterprise software and reinvented how business was done. Today, as a market leader in enterprise application software, we remain true to our roots. That’s why we engineer solutions to fuel innovation, foster equality and spread opportunity for our employees and customers across borders and cultures.<br>
SAP values the entrepreneurial spirit, fostering creativity and building lasting relationships with our employees. We know that a diverse and inclusive workforce keeps us competitive and provides opportunities for all. We believe that together we can transform industries, grow economics, lift up societies and sustain our environment. Because it’s the best-run businesses that make the world run better and improve people’s lives.</p>
<p>
The Partner Support Center is a dynamic group within SAP’s Global Partner Service Delivery team, specifically created as a centralized response center to support NA PartnerEdge members with business issues and program support. Initially designed to assist VARs, the Partner Support Center will expand to other partner types (SIs, ISVs, Distributors, etc.) as the team gains critical knowledge and experience. The overall mission of the Partner Support Center is to provide a high-touch, fast-response “center of expertise” for reselling partners so they have what they need, when they need it in order to grow their SAP software license revenue across the SAP solution portfolio. The Partner Support Center is a complementary function to the Partner Business Manager (PBM) and Partner Service Advisor (PSA) roles. Whereas the PBM and PSA roles are focused on developing partners’ businesses through business planning, demand generation and solution enablement - the Partner Support Center is a one-stop response center that will assist a partner with any programmatic or operational issue they’re faced with and champion a resolution within SAP.</p>
<p>
Key business metrics for success will include inquiry response time, time-to-resolution, response volumes and user satisfaction. Additional metrics will include revenue generated through E&amp;C partners and overal E&amp;C revenue growth.</p>
<p>
The Partner Support Center is staffed with Partner Support Specialists. There are two employment levels of Partner Support Specialists (II, III) - allowing the team to have defined career growth opportunities at the onset. The Partner Support Center is an excellent gateway into SAP for young professionals just graduating from university who are seeking a powerful platform for building their business acumen.</p>
