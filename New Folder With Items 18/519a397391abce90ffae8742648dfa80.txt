The Propulsion Systems Analysis group at Pratt &amp; Whitney is at the forefront of advancing next generation engine capability through engine performance and operability optimization. The Geared Turbofan engine has dominated commercial single-aisle market sales, motivating additional platforms and continued innovation through the next generation product family product line. Likewise, the military products of the F-22 Raptor, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and next generation adaptive cycle engines, are world class engineering innovations that define the state of the art for jet engines. Pratt &amp; Whitney is seeking candidates for Propulsion Systems Analysis with experience in one or more of the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Variable cycle engine thermodynamic modeling</li>
<li>
Adaptive engine control schedule development and optimization</li>
<li>
Development engine performance and modeling</li>
<li>
Analysis of transient engine handling characteristics</li>
<li>
Engine systems stability analysis for operability</li>
<li>
Dynamic systems modeling and control integration</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
Numerical methods for cycle simulation and multidisciplinary optimization Critical skills involve application of steady state and transient thermodynamic principles to a wide range of aircraft engine performance development topics such as product validation, control definition and optimization, cycle studies, and performance improvement packages for thrust, fuel burn, and functional enhancements to the engine. This position is highly inter-disciplinary and team-oriented, requiring excellent communication skills. Travel opportunities may arise depending on project assignments and requirements. Candidates with more extensive team leadership experience will be considered for expanded roles in the Propulsion Systems Analysis organization; those with experience in a portion of the above responsibilities will be evaluated for development and growth opportunities while fulfilling a technical leadership role with support.</p>
