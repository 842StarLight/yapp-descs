 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>At WebPT, innovation is the name of the game. We’re always building, tweaking, and enhancing the wide array of solutions we offer to our customers. But creating awesome products is only half of the equation; to ensure our users get the most out of our tools, we’ve got to let them know what they are, where to find them, how to use them, and why they should care. Essentially, we’ve got to market them. That’s where you come in.</p>
<p>
As WebPT’s Product Marketing Coordinator, you’ll be responsible for helping develop and implement marketing strategies around product and service add-ons as well as application education and training. In this role, you’ll be immersed in every stage of the product lifecycle, working closely with our Product Managers as well as our Sales, Marketing, and Operations teams.</p>

<li>Get ready to fly by the seat of your pants. This role is ever-evolving—just like our team and our marketing strategies—so while you don’t need to be Cirque du Soleil flexible, we may once in awhile ask you to do a few back bends, or at least try some things outside of your wheelhouse.</li>
