<p>Product Marketing Manager – Managed Detection &amp; Response</p>
<p>
Location: San Antonio, Texas or Remote</p>
<p>
Our mission is to reduce risk to customers' business to allow them to achieve their objectives. We are focused on delivering real security value for an affordable price – no snake oil. To help in this mission, we are looking for an experienced Product Marketing Manager to help grow our Managed Security Services offering. You will work in a tight knit, experienced team backed up by an international organization that's been in business for 18 years.</p>
<p>
About Us</p>
<p>
The Managed Detection &amp; Response service is new line of business (think division, business unit, etc) as of this year. We are an experienced team having built successful Managed Security offerings in the past and staffed by veteran cyber-warfare operators from the military and intelligence services. We all got into this business to provide security services that make customers safer. We have to make some money to do that, but our primary goal is to provide services that secure, not just ones that sell.</p>
<p>
Our team has been around the block together and operate in a 24x7 environment where we manage emergency situations for customers. For this to work, we must trust each other. As a leadership team, we focus on building that trust through accountability, processes and personal relationships. We have plenty of experienced folks with and without families and understand that not all teams can be built outside of work, but we do try to get our folks together as often as possible.</p>
<p>
About the Role</p>
<p>
The Managed Detection &amp; Response services are specialized, outcome focused offerings that require people, process and technology to be successful. This role includes the creation of high-level messaging for our services as well as integrated messages across all other business lines. Our enterprise marketing team will leverage your work to deliver messaging and content in to new and existing channels.</p>
<p>
You will be the expert on customer segments and competitive messaging and use your research to develop messaging, positioning and overall go-to-market strategy. You will be a part of our product leadership team so the ability to work with teams to guide roadmap, pricing, package, etc. is a plus. You will own product documentation, sales enablement content, partner enablement, web presence and any other public or sales facing content.</p>
<p>
You will be successful at this role by creating compelling messaging, using that messaging to execute campaigns that drive revenue success while helping drive the development of the product based on your knowledge of the market and customers.</p>
<p>
About You</p>
<p>
You will be the first Product Marketing Manager in our line of business so we're looking for someone with proven experience in previous role. Specifically, experience in creating strategic messaging based on existing markets, executing campaigns using common techniques and measuring success are all important parts of this role. We don't expect anyone to be right all the time, but we encourage experimentation and learning to find the right answers.</p>
<p>
You will need excellent communication skills, a keen eye for detail and an excellent aesthetic sense. It is helpful if you can create good looking content, but you will have access to other teams for help if this isn't your specialty. You will need to be able to manage multiple projects through multiple teams to completion to be successful – including teams in the US, Europe and APAC.</p>
<p>
Our new office is in downtown San Antonio, Texas – one of the hubs for cyber-security in the US. During our initial launch and growth mode, we prefer someone in town if possible, but are willing to consider remote candidates. This role will include some travel – mostly for conferences, visiting customers and advisory boards, but the travel is expected to be limited and flexible.</p>
