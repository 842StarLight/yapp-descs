<div>Here’s what’s possible for H&amp;M DEPARTMENT MANAGERS:</div>
<br>
<div></div>
<div>
Department Managers are responsible for a lot of things here at H&amp;M. From typical managerial things such as sales maximization, customer service and department profitability to coaching teams within a department. And they’re tasked to do it all according to H&amp;M values, standards, policies and procedures. H&amp;M culture, really. But most importantly, we ask our Department Managers to develop their teams. Think of this role as a manager-slash-mentor. Or mentor-slash-manager. Whichever you prefer. Just know that the only way we can become a better company is when we have talented people help unlock what’s possible for everyone around them.</div>
