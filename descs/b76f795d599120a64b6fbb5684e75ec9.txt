About the Position
<br>------------------------
<br><br>
Twitch delivers over 6 billion hours of video per year today. We have one of the largest live video distribution networks in the world and a VOD delivery platform. At Twitch we are working on building a platform to usher in the next few billions of hours of video to be delivered. We believe video delivery is in its infancy and as we look to the horizon, we want to expand our video offerings to customers and partners beyond Twitch.
<br><br>
As the product manager, you will be responsible for rethinking the process of how the current video platform products works for B2B customers as the video platform becomes an independent service. You will manage the Video Platform's Ingest team and help define the customer experience in how all video and associated content is ingested, transcoded, and delivered. You will be responsible for product features that allow customers to create new interactive experiences. You will need to work closely with video platform PMs and engineering to balance prioritizing product deliverables, and managing product teams' expectations. This role will require working closely with multiple product and business teams in Twitch and AWS to drive alignment.
<br><br>
This position is a rare opportunity within Twitch to help launch a new service, and define the first customer interactions to bring them onto a video platform. An ideal candidate will bring both deep technical and PM leadership expertise, strong business acumen, a deep understanding of our customer markets, strong desire to bring clarity to ambiguity, ability to resolve conflicts across teams, and business development experience.
<br><br>
We believe video services as a whole in AWS are just getting started. This is an amazing opportunity to get in on the ground floor within an existing and strong video business.
