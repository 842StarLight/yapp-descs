<h2>Account Manager - Texas, West Central (Midland)</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Indigo is working to harness nature to sustainably feed the planet. We have discovered a transformational opportunity to improve global crop yield and reduce the use of agricultural chemicals and fertilizers by utilizing the core microbiome inside plants to confer material yield and crop protection benefits across a variety of crops, geographies and stresses. The challenge and opportunity for Indigo is to gain critical first mover advantages by scaling quickly and effectively ($5+B 2019 revenue.)
<br><br>
Indigo Account Managers are the primary sales and service touchpoint for our grower customers. They represent Indigo through a new channel to the market and are well versed in all Indigo value propositions. Account Managers execute with the clear objective of supporting the grower in business decisions to help improve profitability on their farm. Customer experience is core to the success of these team members in a quest to develop "enterprise" grower customers.
<br><br>
The role of the Account Manager will be to build and maintain close, emotional relationships with Indigo's grower partners. This role extends far beyond a traditional sales position and will require the candidate to demonstrate strong business acumen, understanding of ag business, and exceptional emotional intelligence. The Account Manager will need to intimately understand Indigo's commercial offerings, articulate the benefits of Indigo's solutions, close the sale with new growers and achieve same store sales growth with their book of business each year. Once the relationship has been established, Account Managers will devote their efforts to delighting their growers with deep knowledge of farm operations, exceptional customer service, selling the complete Indigo portfolio of offerings, and building a long-lasting partnership with growers. The Account Manager will work closely with experienced Indigo Subject Matter Experts to enable grower success by maximizing farm profitability.
