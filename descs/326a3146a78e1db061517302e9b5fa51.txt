<div>At Goodwill Industries® Sacramento Valley &amp; Northern Nevada, Inc. (Goodwill) you’ll hear us say “because of Goodwill” a lot. Often it means, “because of Goodwill I got a hand up” or “because of Goodwill I have a chance.” Our organization is built on a rich history of finding the hidden value and possibility in people and donated goods alike since 1933. Today, we continue to innovate the social enterprise of our founders and lead with our mission to utilize Goodwill resources to help people with disadvantages achieve self-sufficiency in everything we do. This mission is expressed through our retail stores and collection sites which create an accessible shopping experience for all, an environmentally conscious alternative to the landfill, and an employment platform for 2,700 people annually. We go beyond creating jobs alone and provide essential resources to our Family of Nonprofits and regional community partners serving over 350,000 people with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness, veterans, seniors, opportunity youth and children in need every year. That’s over 900,000 life-changing services including job training, emergency shelter for families, resource and referral information, meals, youth advocacy, and mental health counseling. Over 95% of total revenues are dedicated giving back to the communities we serve.</div>
