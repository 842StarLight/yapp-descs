Senior Director, Enterprise Marketing Campaigns</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>
At Zendesk, we take the role of Campaign Marketing seriously. Campaign Marketing is much more than a mid-funnel demand engine; Campaign Managers are strategic marketers who are the hub in a hub and spoke model, collaborating with key Marketing and Sales stakeholders to deliver fully integrated customer journeys across all marketing touchpoints and surfaces, including in-product. We are “whole brain” (both left-brain and right-brain) people, harnessing the power of data to design sophisticated behavior-based campaigns, while also having powerful instincts regarding what makes “good” marketing (including a strong command of full-funnel marketing, from awareness to consideration to purchase to adoption/usage to retention and ultimately advocacy).</b><br>
</p>
<p><b>
We are seeking a senior, accomplished marketing leader with proven, at-scale marketing experience to oversee the development and execution of Zendesk’s enterprise campaign marketing strategy. This includes outbound (generating demand by targeting net new prospects, warming them up with top-of-funnel marketing programs, and delivering lists to Sales to proactively reach out to those contacts), Account Based Marketing (we have laid the groundwork, but are looking for a leader to define ABM 2.0 for us), expansion within existing accounts (which is increasingly triggered and data-driven based on a variety of data points), in-house research for contact discovery and enrichment, and analytics to understand and optimize campaign performance. This role, based in San Francisco, reports to the VP of Global Campaigns &amp; Integrated Marketing and manages a team of 15 plus vendors and agencies.</b></p>
