<p><b>The Company:</b></p>
<p>
Storyblocks is a stock media company that empowers digital storytellers by providing affordable and high quality creative content via a subscription-based service. In addition to supporting video creation through www.videoblocks.com, we have launched two additional properties focused on images (https://www.storyblocks.com/stock-image/) and audio (www.audioblocks.com) with similar subscription models.</p>
<p>
Storyblocks is changing the stock media industry by bringing content to creators, directly where they work. While our company started with humble beginnings (we literally used to sell DVD’s of stock content from the back of an RV), we always knew there was a better way.</p>
<p>
Our content is now featured in major motion pictures, Grammy Award winning music videos, broadcast television, and in the leading content creation applications and social media platforms.</p>
<p>
We’re changing the stock media industry for the better and improving the way that customers find and buy content. Our Enterprise Division will grow by ~100% in 2019 and we’re looking for smart, determined, and creative talent to join our team and help us change the stock media industry!</p>
