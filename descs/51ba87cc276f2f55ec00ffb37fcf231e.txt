<p><b>Physical Requirements / Working Conditions:</b></p>
<p>The physical demands described herein are representative of those that must be met by an employee to perform the essential functions of this job. Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions (team members are required to contact the designated Human Resources in such cases to document the accommodation).</p>
<p>Significant physical strength, physical resilience, and mental alertness is imperative within this job. This is primarily a non-stationary position working in a non-temperature-controlled environment with extended periods of time spent in diverse positions due to diverse nature of customer facilities. Extended periods of sitting or standing at a desk/counter occur to prepare reports and to drive. Significant mental alertness and quick reflexes are required in order to safely drive. Standing and walking is required to interface with customers, gain access to their buildings, which may require the use of stairs, and to deliver communications or product requiring the ability to, lift, carry, climb, reach, stoop, kneel, crouch, and continuous mental and visual attention with eyesight correctable to 20/20 and specific vision requirements of close vision and the ability to adjust focus. Peripheral vision and depth perception are also required for driving safety, and to safely work in diverse customer sites including the possibility of warehouse, production, construction, and other hazardous locations. The employee operates a keyboard/mouse, answers telephone calls and occasionally bends, reaches, and pushes and pulls file drawers to file documents requiring finger and hand dexterity, reaching, lifting, and twisting. While the use of tools is encouraged, employees in this job occasionally carry product weighing up to 125 lbs. across diverse customer conditions that may not allow for material handling equipment. Participation in group lifts for heavier weight is required. Employee may push pallets (using a pallet jack) or push wheeled carts with product weighing over 3,000 lbs. Stacking of batteries occurs with all branch personnel from time to time, requiring physical endurance to move individual units in quantities exceeding 2 tons in a day. The common lifting-related motions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Squat, gain load, stand with load held in lift zone (just above belt-height), slight reach, unload to flat plane, push load (sliding load corner to corner pivot) across flat plane and the reverse</li>
<li>Same as above, adding up to 25 yards of walking with load carried in one hand, by product handle, on the side of the body, with arm hanging straight down at the shoulder</li>
<li>Reach full arm-length (both arms), pull load (sliding load corner to corner pivot alternating arms pulling; both arms used simultaneously for more significant weight) across flat plane to lift zone, lift load, move feet to turn body, place load on flat plane at a similar or improved height (differential made up with squat or squat extension to standing), push load (sliding load corner to corner pivot) across flat plane</li>
<li>Reach full arm-length (both arms), pull load (sliding load corner to corner pivot) across flat plane to lift zone, lift load, move feet to turn body, squat to place load on lower plane</li>
<li>Same as above, adding up to 25 yards of walking with load carried in one hand, by product handle, on the side of the body, with arm hanging straight down at the shoulder, having been lowered there from chest height by arm strength, or raising there by a squat thrust.</li>
</ul>
<p>Team members are required to notify their manager if they believe that they are not able to safely continue to lift and require a temporary recovery period of lighter duties. Personal protective equipment consists of uniform, safety glasses, gloves, and safety-toe shoes (may include ice cleats), and may additionally require apron, face shield, safety goggles, ear protection, and/or rubber gloves in interface with the charging area, installations, and clean-up process.</p>
