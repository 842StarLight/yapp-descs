<p>Chief Marketing Officer – Sensing and IoT Business</p>
<p>JOIN A TEAM RECOGNIZED FOR LEADERSHIP, INNOVATION AND DIVERSITY</p>
<p>Honeywell, a Fortune 100 company generating $39B+ in annual sales, and has been one of Fortunes Most Admired Companies for over a decade. The company designs, develops and delivers solutions that address some of the world’s most critical challenges linked to global macro trends like energy efficiency, sustainability, safety and security, globalization and customer productivity. The business today is organized into four reportable business groups: Aerospace (including automotive); Home and Building Technologies; Performance Materials and Technologies; and Safety and Productivity Solutions. Within the Sensing and IOT business, simply put, we are bringing the “Internet of Things” to life. As the key ingredient in any IoT system, sensors can tell you where you are or what you’re doing, and based off of that information, can quickly convert data into actionable steps or provide guidance in decision making. At Honeywell, we offer a variety of sensor technology for industries ranging from medical, industrial, transportation and aerospace. In addition, we are always looking at the next level of IoT systems, such as miniaturization — creating smaller sensors that can consume less power — and adding connectivity, which allows us to add more intelligence directly to the sensors, and helping facilities adapt to the Internet of Things revolution. The possibilities of what we are doing with sensor technology and the roles sensor technology plays in the IoT within safety and productivity solutions are limitless, and we strive to transform the business from one which is focused on sensors to one which really allows us to enable the Internet of Things.</p>
