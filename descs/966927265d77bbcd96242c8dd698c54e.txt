<p><b>WHO ARE WE?</b></p>
<p><b>About Used Cardboard Boxes, Inc.</b></p>
<p><b>What: </b>UCBZeroWaste / UsedCardboardBoxes.com (UCB) designs &amp; manages large-scale Zero Waste Programs (including Return, Reuse, Resell, Recycle and Waste-to-Energy)<b>.</b></p>
<p><b>How: </b>UCB pays large companies more than recycling rates for re-usable commodities and optimizes their traditional recyclables to create real financial value. That money can be applied to the Waste-to-Energy process… enabling large companies to get to "Zero Waste to Landfill" at minimal out-of-pocket cost.</p>
<p><b>Why: </b>By paying suppliers more than recycling, charging customers less than new packaging, reducing environmental impact, employing people US and making a profit… <b>UCB's business model is a win/win/win/win/win</b>.</p>
<p>When UCB launched in 2006, we built technology and designed processes that enabled UCB to buy used/empty boxes (and gaylord totes) from large US food, beverage and CPG manufactures, for more than recycling rates! These are the gaylord totes and shipping boxes they receive and unpack from their vendors (often carrying bulk food, ingredients, plastic bottles &amp; caps, etc.). UCB can pay more than any recycler, because we don't recycle these boxes…. <b>we RESELL them, as boxes</b>, <i>(mainly to major retailers for distribution and reverse logistics)</i>right here in the US. As a closed-loop sustainability program, <b>we actually RETURN BOXES RIGHT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL VENDOR, for reuse!</b>Our programs help separate valuable commodities to reduce waste and identify the most valuable outlet for each commodity.</p>
<p>Our programs have expanded and today we buy gaylord totes, shipping boxes, pallets, supersaks, barrels and drums… all for MORE than recycling rates… and resell them for less than new.</p>
<p>UCB has created a tremendous amount of value at many large companies (<b>Anheuser-Busch, Bayer, Burlington Coat, Family Dollar/Dollar Tree, Foot Locker, General Mills, Goodwill Industries, Keurig, Menards, McCormick Spice, P&amp;G, Pepsi, Sports Authority/DICK's, Safeway/Albertsons, TJMaxx/Marshalls, Target, True Value, Walmart, and many more)</b>as we are likely the largest buyer/seller of quality USED boxes in the country… and now manage almost any byproduct of food/bev/cpg manufacturing or distribution.</p>
<p><b>UCB's proprietary software is called WATER: Waste Analytics and Tracking for Environmental Reporting.</b></p>
<p>One thing that separates UCB from "local box brokers" and surely "traditional recyclers" and even "waste consultants" is our online, real-time tracking tools that report down to the SKU-level, allowing for continuous improvement programs. This keeps ALL of UCB's supplier's reuse, recycling and waste data in one place, for easy (and accurate) online, real-time reporting… at their fingertips! For UCB customers (who buy these used commodities), this same real-time data enables buyers to view inventory to see what meets their needs, compare used pricing to new pricing and even place orders online.</p>
