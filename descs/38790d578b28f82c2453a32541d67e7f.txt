<h2>Digital Marketing Associate</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Words matter. Whether you’re writing marketing copy, product content, knowledge bases, or employee handbooks, the goal is the same: to have clear, consistent, and on-brand content that educates, informs and delights your readers. Everybody in an organization writes, but not everyone is a professional writer, nor can they all be expected to write with the same level of consistency, voice, and tone. Qordoba solves this problem by helping teams write clear, consistent, and on-brand content at scale. Companies such as Marriott, Braintree, and Postmates use Qordoba to create better content up to 90% faster than before.
