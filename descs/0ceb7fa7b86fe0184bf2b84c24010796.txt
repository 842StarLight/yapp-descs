<p>Are you personable, outgoing, professional and looking for an entry level office position in an interesting local company? If yes, then let's talk!</p>
<p>We are looking for someone who can help us with our sales, as well as with our various clerical duties throughout the year. Companies want to reach our customers, and you'd offer them advertising and other partnerships. You'd occasionally visit some of your clients in the region (less than 30 miles away), so some out of office traveling is occasionally required (on average, less than a few days per month).</p>
<p>Additionally, you'd help us with customer questions, processing their paperwork, etc.</p>
<p>This would be a full time, year round position, with the possibility of having the summers off pending your availability and interest.</p>
<p>Please send a cover letter noting why you'd be an excellent fit, as well as an up to date resume for us to review.</p>
