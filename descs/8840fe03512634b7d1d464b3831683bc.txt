<p>Hey I'm Ari Bixhorn — I run marketing for a B2B (and soon-to-be B2C) SaaS company called Panopto. I'm looking for a seasoned digital marketer with experience in website design, information architecture, analytics, user experience, and SEO to manage our public website. If you're driven by growing website traffic and increasing visitor conversion through a combination of data-driven analysis and an elegant user experience, then read on.</p>

The scoop on Panopto</b></div>
<div>
At Panopto (Pan-<b>ahp'</b>-toh), we believe that video can dramatically improve the way people learn and communicate. We also believe that video should be much easier to work with than it is today. So we build a video platform that includes:</div>
<ul>
<li><div>
A "corporate YouTube" that makes it easy for businesses and universities to securely store and share all of their video content</div></li>
<li><div>
A unique video search engine that allows people to find and fast-forward to any word spoken in any video</div></li>
<li><div>
Recording and live streaming apps that enable anyone to create professional-looking video presentations like this in minutes</div></li>
<li><div>
Other video geekery that we can discuss during the interview</div></li>
</ul>
<div></div>

Our headquarters is in Seattle's historic Smith Tower. We also have offices in Pittsburgh, London, Hong Kong, and Sydney. Here are a few pics of our Seattle office where this job is based: our neighborhood, the awesome Smith Tower elevators, the pool table, Howie (our VP of Engineering's dog), and Steve and Tania (actual employees actually enjoying each others' company).</div>
<div></div>

<div>
Our work environment combines the best qualities of agile startups and more stable, larger businesses. We make decisions quickly, experiment constantly, and communicate transparently. We don't have the internal politics or unnatural barriers between teams often found at big software companies. And yet we have great benefits including comprehensive medical, vision, dental, and life insurance, a 401k retirement plan with employer matching, commuter assistance, community involvement, and more. We also have a great time-off policy, including 3 weeks of paid vacation when you start plus all major holidays (including the last week of December), 2 floating holidays, and a week of sick leave. For two years running, we've been recognized by Fortune Magazine and Great Place to Work Institute as one of the nation's top small workplaces.</div>
