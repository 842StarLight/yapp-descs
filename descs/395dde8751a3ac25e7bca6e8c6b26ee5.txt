<h2>City Brand Ambassador - Mesquite</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">goPuff is the first digital convenience retailer that was founded in 2013. Our co-founders Rafael and Yakir were 20 years old and sophomores at Drexel University in Philadelphia when they decided that stocking their college townhouse with snacks and essentials was taking way too long and trips to the store were too hard to pull off on top of balancing school, work and friends. So they spent all night drafting mockups of the app on the back of their Intro to Business notes.- iconic!
<br><br>
Three months later they were delivering those same convenience items from the back of their Plymouth Voyager around campus. The service caught on, the name stuck, and now we are in over 90 markets with no plans of slowing down. - the hustle is real!
