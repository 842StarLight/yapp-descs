Position Description:</b></p>
<p>
The legacy SPECTRUM XXI application is a client/server, Windows-based software system that provides frequency managers with a single information system to address spectrum management automation requirements. SPECTRUM XXI supports operational planning and management of the radio frequency spectrum with an emphasis on assigning compatible frequencies and performing spectrum engineering tasks. SPECTRUM XXI is the Joint standard system for spectrum management throughout the DOD. It has also been adopted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for processing frequency records for federal agencies. SPECTRUM XXI was also provided to over 22 foreign nations through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and these efforts have paid off with SPECTRUM XXI being used by all NATO International Security Assistance Forces spectrum management elements in the Afghan Area of Operations.</p>

SXXI is a mission critical National Security System (NSS) used by the Department of Defense (DOD), National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), other U.S. Federal Agencies, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and foreign allies for strategic and tactical operations. The system is designated as the DOD’s Joint Frequency Assignment system, and it has been in use operationally at the DOD since 1999. The system provides a suite of tools and workflow automation to process frequency requests and manage use of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., radio frequencies).</p>
<p>
DOD, NTIA and International instances/versions of the system exist and operate on different networks. They share a common codebase, however some features and data are only available to the DOD. SXXI follows a client-server architecture, and the SXXI client contains the following modules: Frequency Assignment, Interference Analysis, Electronic Warfare, Joint Restricted Frequency List (JRFL), Engineering Tools, Compliance, Allotment Plan Generator, Data Exchange, Topo Manager, Spectrum Certification System and System Tools. It interoperates with the NTIA Federal Spectrum Management System and any system that complies with the Standard Frequency Action Format (SFAF) frequency record data standard. No existing Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) system or other Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) system meets SXXI system requirements.</p>
