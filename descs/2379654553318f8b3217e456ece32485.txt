<p>
The Sales Development Representative will thrive in a start-up environment – able to roll up your sleeves and do what’s necessary to succeed. The SDR is responsible for generating the first point of contact with our newest mid-sized prospects in the ACE (Architecture, Construction, &amp; Engineering) vertical in the Greater New York City area.
