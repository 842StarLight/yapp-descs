“Truno is my love letter to international food!” -Executive Chef Dwayne Motley</p>

Inspired by the Icelandic idea of having a “Truno,” which is the act of sharing stories and secrets with friends or strangers over drinks, we wanted to open a bar and restaurant where we could share cocktail creations, secret recipes, good food and great stories from around the world with our guests. Truno is a place where intimate stories, colorful cultures and local flavors bring people together in an authentic and inspired way. Welcome to Truno.</p>
