 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">About the Role
<br><br>
We're bringing brand measurement into the age of AI. As a Product Manager, you will lead a team of agile software engineers, designers and data scientists to create a vision and then rapidly iterate on a product line that you own. You will leverage our Fortune 500 client-base to rapidly validate and de-risk your product vision and cutting-edge features for brand advertising measurement and optimization.
<br><br>
You will collaborate closely with your cross-functional product team to specify new features and effectively communicate and evangelize them throughout the sales and marketing organization. Your product team will move fast because you run ahead of them, validating and specifying work to maintain a high feature velocity.
