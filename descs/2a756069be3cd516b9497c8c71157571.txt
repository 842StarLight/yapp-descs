<p><b>Sales Account Executive
</b></p>
<p>YourCause, a Blackbaud company, defines and practices ‘sales’ differently from the norm. Yes, we’re looking for an ambitious, energetic individual who will have immediate impact on business growth, but it’s not a ‘another day, another dollar’ state of mind. One of our core values is partnership, which means a YourCause sales executive will be a product evangelist, be a diligent team player and commit to creating relationships, designing solutions with corporations, and building the Global Good Network.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The right team member should be well-rounded, flexible, creative, and forward thinking. You will diligently explore our potential clients’ challenges and goals; forging a partnership to help create program efficiencies in partnership with YourCause. You’ll be completely immersed in our company’s operations as we continue to develop intuitive technology that helps companies connect with their employees and the causes they care about most. You will be expected to provide valuable industry insights to your prospects while positioning our solution. Our sales executives set the tone for first impressions, and we’ve built a reputation we’d like to keep.
