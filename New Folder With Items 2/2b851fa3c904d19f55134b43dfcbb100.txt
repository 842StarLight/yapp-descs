<h2>Senior Systems Administrator</h2>

<p>We're looking for a Senior Systems Administrator to join our growing technical team.</p>
<p><b>
Who we are:</b></p>
<p>
MyITpros is a managed services IT provider for small to medium sized companies. When it doesn’t make sense for a smaller company to have a fully-staffed IT department, that’s where we come in. We've been partnering with Austin businesses for more than 25 years to provide the best possible IT support. Anything from user support to an entire network refresh, we make sure our clients are always up and running.</p>
<p>
But what sets us apart from the competition is our culture. We value the opportunity to learn and improve which is why we encourage technical certifications and even pay for them. We also cultivate a truly collaborative environment. Our technical staff is divided into teams so you’re able to work together on issues and get help whenever you need it.</p>
<p><b>
What you'll do:</b></p>
<p>
As a Senior Systems Administrator, you’ll design and maintain various IT infrastructures for a subset of clients on your team. These responsibilities will require you to maintain client satisfaction through the timely resolution of technical issues. Your day-to-day activities will include serving as the escalation point for other service members, troubleshooting technical issues, and managing project work.</p>
<p>
A successful candidate for this position will have a passion for all things technology and helping others. If you believe you would be a good fit for our fun, laid-back, but hard-working culture, follow the link at the bottom to submit your resume and cover letter.</p>
