Our jobs aren’t just about giving guests a smooth check-in and check-out. Instead, we want to build and experience that is memorable and unique. Our Guest Experience Specialists take the initiative to deliver a wide range of services that guide guests through their entire stay. Their role goes beyond the traditional front desk to take ownership of the guest experience in the main areas of the hotel with a “guest first” mindset. They are empowered to move about their space and do what needs to be done. Whether processing operational needs, addressing guest requests, completing reports, delivering quality meals, or sharing the highlights of the local area, the Guest Experience Specialist makes transactions feel like part of the experience.<div>

No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe work place, following company policies and procedures, maintaining confidentiality, protecting company assets, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Experience Specialists will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Experience Specialists – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.</div>
