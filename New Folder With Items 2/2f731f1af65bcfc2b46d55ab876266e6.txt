HCA, a Fortune 100 company with more than 200,000 employees, is one of the nation's leading providers of healthcare services, operating over 170 locally managed hospitals and over 100 freestanding surgery centers in 20 states and the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>
The National Contact Center Management (NCCM) group serves our patients by interacting with them via telephone and other media in order to assist them with their healthcare journeys. NCCM uses a variety of tools that act in tandem with each other and on behalf of our patients and provides services such as provider referrals, connection with healthcare services, and clinical advice.<br>
<br>
As a patient care liaison (PCL), you will focus your compassionate care on our patients by phone. You may complete tasks such as finding healthcare providers who fit our patients’ needs, scheduling appointments, and following up with those patients to ensure their healthcare needs were met. Our patients rely on us to help them navigate complex healthcare situations and provide guidance and next steps. If you have had previous successful call center experience, you’ll notice right away that this is not a sales position and we do not cold call. If you have not had previous call center experience, there are some traits that can predict your fit.<br>
<br>
We will train you on the applications and the software. Great PCLs have growth and advancement opportunities. Expect to think, talk, and type 55 words per minute. For many, our patient care liaisons are the first impression our patients and consumers have of our health system, and you’ll have a big impact on their quality of care.<br>
<br>
Patient care liaison positions start at $13.89 per hour and have with quarterly performance reviews. Rapid advancement is possible based on performance. Training is paid and you’ll work with a mentor. Health, dental and vision start after 75 days.
