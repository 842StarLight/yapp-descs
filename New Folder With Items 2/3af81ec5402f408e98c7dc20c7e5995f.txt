<h2>Store Manager</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>This is Outerknown’s first public brick and mortar. This is big.</p>
<p>
A place for community and product discovery, both paying homage to those that came before and continuing the legacy. We’re looking for that unique individual to represent Outerknown and lead a team in the South Bay. The person chosen for this role should know and understand the impact of Dale Velzy, Bruce Brown, Hap Jacobs, and historic Manhattan Beach in the 40’s/50’s. We’re opening in the South Bay for a reason and we’re looking for someone to carry the torch.</p>
<p><b>
OVERVIEW</b></p>
<p>
The Store Manager (SM) is responsible for overseeing the operational execution of the store; ensures positive customer experiences; demonstrates ability to meet individual sales and metric goals; drives profitable top-line sales growth and coaches store associates to consistently provide customers with an exceptional shopping experience.</p>
<p>
“At Outerknown, we’re making every decision with the highest regard for the hands that build our clothes and the world we call home. From seed to suppliers to circular design, our mission is to protect our natural resources, empower the people crafting our clothes, and inspire change within the industry and beyond. We believe you shouldn’t have to sacrifice style for sustainability - the two should be synonymous.”</p>
<p>
Outerknown is looking for a Store Manager to join the team and help us expand into brick &amp; mortar retail. This is a pivotal role in the company and will involve both store operations – conceptualizing and build-out, recruiting and training a store team, and managing our first store – as well as translating operating learnings into strategic recommendations for a broader roll-out in the future. The Store Manager will also oversee “OuterSpace”, the retail space at Outerknown HQ for pop-up events and private shopping experiences.</p>

DEFINING THE SM ROLE</b></p>
<p>
Awesome SMs are outgoing, engaging, and determined to achieve results. At the same time, they prefer consistency and order, slow down enough to carefully evaluate information and trends, and focus on customers and associates. Awesome SM’s give credit to their team when it’s due rather than take credit for themselves.</p>
<p>
A top performing SM drives execution in the store through coaching of sales associates which results in profitable top-line sales growth. A consistent and positive customer experience is coached and reinforced both on the sales floor and in the backroom. The SM understands the key business drivers and adjusts the business accordingly. The Operations Team &amp; HQ provide clear direction and feedback so the SM can focus on execution.</p>
