<p><b>Requisition Number: </b><b>70150</b></p>
<p>
Salespeople in the Information Technology industry have the almost impossible challenge of keeping track of details and specifications on thousands of products. As a Dell EMC Storage Business Development Manager (BDM), you’re not going to make that any easier for them…</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
You will, however, make it easier for them to sell one specific brand of products. As BDM you will become the premier advocate for the vendor who sponsors your program. You will become the go-to expert for information on all their products, making sure that every Insight salesperson knows your products, likes your products, presents and promotes your products. Part of the way in which you will do this involves communicating enthusiastically and effectively to the Insight sales team on a consistent basis.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
The other way you will promote your product line is by making it as easy to sell your products and take advantage of your sponsor’s programs as possible. You’ll manage deal registration to make sure our salespeople get the best prices protected from the source. You’ll make sure that every request for information, demonstrations, special pricing actions, program participation, vendor expert advice and involvement and more are answered and fulfilled immediately.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
To continue growing your ability to be your sponsor’s best representative and best advocate within Insight, you’ll participate in every training, every meeting, every planning session, and every interaction Insight has with that vendor. You will be the point person promoting your products proactively and persistently to all Insight sales resources and their customers.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>
You’ll also earn greater respect and support from your sponsor for yourself, your program, and Insight by providing aggressive reporting on your successful sales growth, and driving new program ideas and requests leveraging that great news. You will effectively run your sponsor’s business within Insight.</p>
