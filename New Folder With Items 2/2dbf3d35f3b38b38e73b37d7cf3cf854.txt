About the Team</b><div>
Every day, riders take over 3 billion trips on public transportation, making mass transit vastly larger than ridesharing. Uber Transit seeks to provide transit agencies and transit riders with the best possible transit experience - saving time and reducing costs while gaining efficiencies. Imagine a future where Bikes, Buses, Trains, Subways, Ferries, UberPool, Scooters, and UberX seamlessly interconnect to lower cost, reduce congestion and cut pollution. That future starts today.</div>
