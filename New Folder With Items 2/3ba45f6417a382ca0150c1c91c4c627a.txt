<h2>Sr. Director FP&A</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>For the last 100 years, companies have operated primarily under a product-centric business model, where the goal was to make, ship, and sell more units. Today, there’s a demand to have products and services delivered on a continual, subscription basis; to upgrade and access new innovations and features constantly. This is the end of ownership and it changes everything. Our vision is “The World Subscribed” where one day every company will be a part of the Subscription Economy® (a phrase coined by our CEO, Tien Tzuo).</p>
<p>
Zuora provides cloud-based software on a subscription basis that enables any company in any industry to successfully launch, manage, and transform into a subscription business. Our growth story is only just beginning and our Finance &amp; Accounting team is pivotal in driving business performance and providing insights for optimal business decision-making. We’re looking for a Senior Director of FP&amp;A to help build a world-class finance organization with best in class processes around reporting, planning, analysis and strategy.</p>
<p>
As the Senior Director of FP&amp;A, you’ll drive cross functional, strategic planning and deliver value-added business analysis for our Sales, Marketing as well as G&amp;A and Overhead teams (Finance, Legal, HR, IT and Global Facilities). As a key partner to Zuora’s Chief Revenue Officer, you’ll partner with multiple executives to define and report on meaningful financial and operational metrics that lead to insightful, accurate business decision-making. As a key leader in our Finance organization, you’ll also work with Zuora’s Executives to provide valuable decision support and will be the primary conduit between the Business Units and Corporate Accounting. Get ready to roll-up your sleeves, build relationships and make an impact on our growing, global SaaS company.</p>
