<h2>Project Manager - Media & Entertainment - Atlanta, GA</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">As a Media and Entertainment (M&amp;E) Project Manager, you will assist with the successful monitor and control of all lifecycles of the project. Our projects span multiple disciplines, technologies, and locations with a focus on technical implementations, requiring project managers to keep the big picture in focus while diving into the unique engineering challenges the teams face daily. Your excellent communication, organization, technical and business acumen, passion for growth, and interpersonal skills will inspire your teams and establish trust with customers and cross-functional team members. You will be expected to clearly communicate goals, optimize schedules, prioritize work packages, track financials, and desired outcomes to internal and external stakeholders. You will ensure that each system is professionally installed, on time, highly profitable, and resulting in long-term client relationships.
<br><br>
The right candidate possesses a strong project management background, has experience leading complex technical projects, and has a background in developing and deploying M&amp;E and IT projects. You must be able to thrive and succeed in an entrepreneurial environment, and not be hindered by ambiguity or competing priorities. The role requires a willingness to handle complex and sometimes difficult financial conversations with stakeholders, both internal and external. The ability to display the value of a proposed solution to stakeholders and stand behind decisions is critical to success. This means you can develop and drive high-level deliverables, and if required, roll up your sleeves to get the job done by managing your own time without direct guidance. You anticipate issues, provide risk management, and balance the business needs versus technical and schedule constraints. You have the innate ability to take large-complex projects and break them down into manageable work packages, develop execution strategies, then deliver per the schedule. Succinct documentation, analytical thinking, flexibility, and leadership are essential to success in this role.
