<div>
<div>A Probe Process Engineer with ON Semiconductor supports manufacture and testing of Image Sensor parts. The primary responsibility of the Probe Process Engineer is to improve probe processes and drive engineering issues to resolution with the objective to maximize yield and minimize the time it takes to successfully probe wafers with the highest quality possible. The Probe Process Engineer will be an escalation path for shift Probe Process Engineers with yield issues that occur, helping them minimize troubleshooting time while decreasing reprobe rate due to faster reaction to site striping, setup issues, fab issues or program problems. The Probe Process Engineer will work with the manufacturing and Image Sensor Group Test Engineering groups to implement SPC for probe (with the desired metrics) and the procedures required to manage this system. Additionally, the Probe Process Engineer will become the expert at O+ software and work with those teams to transition from the current systems in place for flags and pause bins to O+ monitoring/alarms. The long-term goal is to have a mature process in place for the probe team to monitor testing performance with the ability to troubleshoot and make improvements to the established processes.</div>
