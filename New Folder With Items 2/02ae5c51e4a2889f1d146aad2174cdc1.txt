<p>Senior Digital Project Manager</p>
<p>
Founded in 2001, IntuitSolutions is a leading technology company based in Old City Philadelphia that offers its employees a full suite of company sponsored benefits, a generous time off policy and on-the-job training opportunities second to none.</p>
<p><b>
The Company</b>: IntuitSolutions is a small, well-established boutique agency that specializes in creating and managing web design, development, and digital marketing for merchants on BigCommerce, WordPress, and other platforms. We work with clients on a scale ranging from template installations and other minor jobs to complete website management including design, custom features, integrations with other software or services, and managed monthly content and structure optimization. We keep regular office hours and complete nearly all work on-site in-house. Please do not contact us about contract work or telecommuting.</p>
<p><b>
The Position</b><b>:</b> We are looking for a detailed and reliable project manager to work directly with our development team and help manage client relationships. You will take ownership of many day-to-day client interactions and third-party communications. The tasks of the project manager will include all responsibilities regarding documentation, CRM maintenance, invoicing, SOWs, change orders, and status reports. The ideal candidate will be competent in prioritizing and working with little supervision. You need to be self-motivated and trustworthy. The project manager ensures smooth running of our digital projects and contributes to driving sustainable growth of the business.</p>
<p>
Client Management</p>
<p>
You will be expected to be thorough and thoughtful in overseeing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>manage expectations of client regarding billing, scope and timeline of project</li>
<li>make sure out of scope items are handled appropriately and communicated to client</li>
<li>ensure changes to timeline due to internal or external events are communicated to client</li>
<li>educate and upsell clients on our various services</li>
</ul>
<p>Project Management</p>
<p>
You will be expected to accurately execute the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>affirm invoices are correct and billed appropriately</li>
<li>ensure project details are accurate (statuses, budgets, logged time, dates, etc.)
</li>
<li>coordinate with development to improve and further develop practices</li>
</ul>
<p>Client Communication</p>
<p>
Clear communication is key. The most successful projects are ones where the client’s questions are answered before they ask them. Your job is to manage their expectations, telling them what to expect from our team and when they should expect work delivered to them. This alleviates the possibility of a client being surprised by the delivery date of work, our work processes, or even when a client request is out of scope from the defined project.</p>
<p>
Developer Communication</p>
<p>
You will be expected to utilize standing meetings with our Team Leads for project status updates and regular issue handling. Just as we want clients to compile a single list of requests we want to take this approach internally in order to best utilize each other's time. Context shifting is a real productivity killer so working in this way is ideal.</p>
<p>
Upselling<br>
While your priority will be managing the project itself, you are to serve as an advocate for the client when it comes to additional services and products. Help them make informed buying decisions about the valuable services and products we offer. The project wrap up is the perfect time to discuss “what’s next” for improving the client’s online business.</p>
