About the Organization</b></p>
<p>
With the industry's largest database of retail intelligence, the deepest inventory of impulse products, and the most experienced team, we're the premier strategic merchandising partner to North America's retailers.<br>
<br>
Jacent sources, warehouses, ships, and stocks over 3,500 impulse items to 14,000 retail stores across the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico. We create a strategic merchandising plan for each store-then place the ideal impulse items in the ideal locations, with follow-up re-ordering and re-stocking. In addition to our impulse business, Jacent offers retail insights and services, such as audits and shelf stocking, to help stores run at peak efficiency.<br>
<br>
The result of our work is two-fold: By connecting consumers with the right items-even ones they didn't know they were looking for-we inspire shopping experiences. And in the process, we're helping our retail customers generate incremental sales. It's a win-win.<br>
