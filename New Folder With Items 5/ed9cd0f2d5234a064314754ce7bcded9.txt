<br>
Triangle Technology has been a presence in the Texas high tech community since 1998. Our business is booming and we are searching for qualified recruiters to join our teams in Houston and Austin. We handle technical placements in all areas from Telecommunications, Networking, Software and Internet Development, Technical Sales, and more.<br>
<br>
We are looking for people that have previous recruiting experience along with a proven track record of success. Main responsibilities will include sourcing, screening, and the placement of highly specialized IT consultants. Other duties include lead generation &amp; building lasting client relationships. You must be a team player with a positive attitude; excellent communication and people skills are a must.<br>
<br>
We offer both base + commission as well as commission-only models and both have the potential of paying at least $100,000/yr total compensation based on you hitting your goals (although commission-only is higher risk, higher reward). In addition, we offer a complete benefit package including health, dental, vision, and 401k.</p></div>
