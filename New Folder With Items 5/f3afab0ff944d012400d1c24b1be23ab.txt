Meridian, MS is a place people love to call home. The community has an amazing musical and artistic history that combines the best of a small town atmosphere with the amenities of a much larger city. We are the hometown of the Father of Country Music, Jimmie Rodgers, award winning actress Sela Ward, and the home of the new Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Experience. Meridian is also home to several highly impactful military installations, including NAS Meridian, one of only a few Navy jet fighter training units in the Country. With two interstate highways and a regional airport offering daily jet service flights to a major hub, Meridian is convenient to everywhere. Education and athletics are central to the lifestyle here, with three community colleges, two four year universities, and we are located less than an hour and a half drive from three major Division I universities with outstanding athletic programs.
