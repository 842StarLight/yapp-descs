<p>If you answered <b>YES</b> to the questions above, then the Director of Operations at P97 may be the career step you are looking for.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>The Director of Operations is a Houston based role reporting to the COO with the primary responsibility of helping to grow, manage, and mature the current Operations team, which includes the Network Operations Center, the IT and Security Department, the Compliance Department, and Professional Services. The Director of Operations will have direct day-to-day management responsibility for the P97 Network Operations Center environment and team with the goal of transitioning them into a world-class 24/7/365 Network Operations Center that will offer customer service and support to P97 clients globally that exceeds every expectation and can handle any complex network, system, or application support situation necessary.
