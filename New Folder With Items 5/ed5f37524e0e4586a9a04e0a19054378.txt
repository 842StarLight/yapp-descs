 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p><b>We are Nelly's Security and we are looking for a really great techie type person with a little bit of inside selling skils!</b></p>
<p>I wont bore you with the typical style job post. If this concept bothers you, you should probably stop reading right now as you are probably not going to be the person we want to hire. We are Nelly's Security, simply put, the best security products distributor on earth. We are looking for fun, energetic, smart people who want to join our team on our quest to be the largest security products distributor in the world. When we hire, we are looking for lifers. People who want to make a career and share the vision we have in such a way that you can barely contain your excitement when speaking to others about it.</p>
<p><b>The type of person we are looking for: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Computer Savvy / Techie Type</b> - You dont have to know everything about CCTV or Security, but you would need to be very good with computers, networks, and other tech related things and you would have to be a lightning fast learner. If you dont know what a left click on a mouse is, you wont succeed here. (Please note that not knowing what a right click is will also most likely disqualify you)</li>
<li>
<b>Gotta be a People's Person!</b> - You will be working with real humans on the phone as well as in person all day and they must love you and you must atleast act like you love them! You gotta have a fun and engaging personality. Computer nerds are very welcome for this position, but you must be the cool type of computer nerd. The wierd type of computer nerds that normally dont like human interaction should not apply. No offense against wierd computer nerds, you have a place in this world, just not here at Nelly's.</li>
<li>
<b>You have to be able to explain complex things in a simple way</b> - Einstein said "The definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple". We need genius communicators. Our motto is "Explain things in a manner that your grandma can understand them"</li>
<li>
<b>Needs to be a problem solver, not a problem maker</b> - Even after you are fully trained, their will be many times in which you are faced with a problem in which you dont immediately dont know the answer to. We are looking for the type of people who will figure out the solution as if their head will spontaneously explode if they dont figure it out. If faced with a problem that you dont immediately know the answer to, you should not apply for this job if your immediate reaction is to A) Ask the next person without doing any research B) Give up C) Act like you know what you are talking about and simply spit out information that sounds smart but really makes no sense at all.</li>
<li>
<b>Needs to work well independtly but be a great team mate as well</b> - You will be working on your own quite a bit solving customers problems, but you will also bond together with your team on certain tasks and projects as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>So, if you are the type of person we are looking for, here is what you would be doing on a daily basis: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answering numerous phone calls and helping customers solve problems and answer questions with their security products they purchased from us. You will be working with seasoned veterans in which you will be talking with on a frequent basis and developing relationships with over time as well as newbies who know nothing at all about this type of equipment. If you hate being on the phone, run away right now!</li>
<li>Answering numerous emails pertaining to the same stuff as described in the bullet point above.</li>
<li>Inside sales duties involving: Dealing with customers who call in and email pre-sale questions. Helping potential customers pick out the right products whether it be designing an entire system or picking a piece to add to their current system. So not only do know have to know the tech, you also have to put that knowledge to work to sell the equipment as well.</li>
<li>Testing customer returns - quite often we get stuff that people return in which their is nothing wrong with, you must determine this through testing.</li>
<li>Between tech support calls you will also sometimes work on fun project type stuff such as making instructional videos and guides, checking out new product features and firmwares, and testing new products.</li>
<li>Hey, we have alot of fun here, but I wouldnt say its easy, its hard work and sometimes it gets really busy, you have to be a good multi-tasker. It all boils down to "Being Great is not easy, but its very rewarding" So while the work is hard, if you like your job, you wont mind the hard work.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Our culture: What we are about, what we want from you, and how we can take on the world together.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>We have fun but be prepared to work!</b> As you can see so far, we have a very laid back culture here as far as personality goes, but please dont mistake this for a laid back work ethic. We take our mission very serious and we work very hard accordingly to get there.</li>
<li>
<b>Unrelenting expectation of excellence.</b> We dont expect perfection, but we expect you to strive for it. When doing any task, the ol saying goes "anything worth doing is worth doing right"</li>
<li>
<b>100% effort</b> - We expect 100% all out effort when you are here. I often compare this to a sports team, if one person on the team isnt giving it 100%, it effects the whole team. Why not give your 100% best on your career just as you would any sports game? Plus it makes for a much shorter day!</li>
<li>
<b>Liking your job is a requirement - </b> You need to have fun here. The hard work wont seem like work oftentimes because you are having fun. If you arent having fun, then why work here? We got a mission, you gotta be on board, and the only way to be on board is to enjoy what you do.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Deets about the position: </b></p>
<p>Entry Level Position: This an entry level position who wants to make a serious run at the tech industry. We are not looking for people who need a little money for a season of time and then move on to the next thing.
