The Department of Finance Purchasing Division is looking for a Storekeeper I to join the Central Stores team. The ideal candidate will be independently motivated to provide excellent customer service to the City while performing daily responsibilities involving the receipt, issuance and delivery of materials, equipment and supplies.<br>
<br>
Under general direction of the Principal Storekeeper, the Storekeeper I engages in materials management including, but not limited to, purchasing materials and supplies, supporting surplus disposal, researching suppliers, and maintaining the inventory management system while performing related work as required. This is an excellent opportunity to work in a dynamic and collaborative team environment.<br>
<br>
<b>DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS</b></p>
<p><b>
Storekeeper I</b> is the entry-level classification for this job series. Initially, incumbents perform assigned duties under immediate supervision, while learning related policies and procedures. The Storekeeper I is distinguished from the Storekeeper II by the performance of less than the full range of duties assigned to the Storekeeper II. As experience is gained, there is a greater independence of action within established guidelines.</p>
<p><b>
Storekeeper</b> <b>II </b>is an experienced journey-level classification in the series. Incumbents are expected to independently perform the full scope of duties associated with the receipt, storage and inventory of materials, equipment and supplies. Storekeeper II is distinguished from the higher-level classification of Principal Storekeeper in that the Principal Storekeeper is responsible for providing direct supervision to assigned personnel. Positions in this class are flexibly staffed and may be filled by advancement from the I level once the incumbent meets the qualification standards of the II level, demonstrates an ability to consistently perform the full scope of work, and meets performance expectations. Incumbents are not automatically promoted to the higher level; the operational needs and budgetary requirements of the department determine the level of assignment.</p>
