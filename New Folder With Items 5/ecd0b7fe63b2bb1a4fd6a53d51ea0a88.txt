<h2>Senior UX Designer, Pure1</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">BE PART OF BUILDING THE FUTURE.
<br><br>
Since our founding in 2009, Pure Storage has empowered innovators to build a better world with data. In less than eight years, Pure reached $1B in sales, faster than nearly every enterprise company in history, and our incredible growth continues to outpace the competition.
<br><br>
Our mission? Deliver a simple, evergreen data platform that enables everyone to turn data into intelligence and advantage. The secret sauce? More than 3,000 team members (and growing!) around the world who join forces to invent the next big thing. And then the next one.

The world is experiencing a revolution driven by next-generation technology like AI, machine learning, virtual reality, quantum computing, and self-driving cars—all of which require unprecedented amounts of data. This sets the stage for Pure's technology to grow exponentially in the coming years.

<li>Our customer-first culture and unwavering commitment to innovation have earned us a Satmetrix Net Promoter Score in the top 1% of B2B companies globally.</li>
<li>Pure puts a premium on the future, investing 26% of revenue into R&amp;D.</li>
</ul>
If you, like us, say "bring it on" to exciting challenges that change the world, we have endless opportunities where you can make your mark.
