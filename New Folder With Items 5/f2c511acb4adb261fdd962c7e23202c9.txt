If you're feeling stressed or maybe just competitive, play some ping pong or take the company up on one of its many sponsored recreational activities (think: yoga, soccer, rock climbing). Our offices are sprinkled around the globe, too, as we have an office in Austin, Boston, New York City, Singapore, London, and Chengdu, China.
