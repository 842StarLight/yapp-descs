If you recognize the global challenges being faced by retailers in linking customer data and contextualizing their offerings across an increasingly complex and omnichannel landscape, then you are probably searching for the solutions we already have.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
If you’ve been at the table with retailers and B2C enterprises frustrated by a lack of insight around customer granularity and personalization, you’ll know what we’re onto.</div>
<div>

<div>
If you yearn for a role in an organization that is entrepreneurial, innovative fast paced, and agile enough to adapt to customer needs...then you will enjoy this role.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
If the thought of offering retailers and FMCG brands tech that is truly unique, that saves time, cuts through existing IT complexity, makes people look good by delivering immediate revenue and cost returns for enterprise customers in the $millions … then we might just be the place for you.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
We’re looking for individuals to join us who are excited about the marketing transformation being driven by the rise of the mobile consumer and who have made a name for themselves bringing innovative marketing technology to leading global brands.</div>

You’ll be the kind of person that enjoys unpacking major client business challenges, and you won’t be afraid to hold a point of view. You’ll also be on a stealth ramp up to acquire the who’s who of brands globally and you’ll know how to make that happen without being spoon-fed.</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>
If you are comfortable rolling up your sleeves, being in the trenches with everyone from the start and holding up your end of the action and perhaps have already experienced success from a green field before, come and talk to us.</div>
