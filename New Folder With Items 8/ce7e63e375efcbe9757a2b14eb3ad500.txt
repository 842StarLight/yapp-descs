<div>
<p>As a Product Manager at NuVasive, you will be responsible for spearheading product development efforts and helping lead a product design from inception through the development process. You'll partner with engineers, surgeons and a diverse population of internal/external shareowners on design iterations through global commercialization and launch. You'll help define market requirements for our TLA product line, including strategy, and pricing. This is an amazing opportunity for someone who can view this role as a true business owner; with passion and internal drive to manage products in several stages of development (i.e. existing portfolio, near-term launch, pending FDA approval and new products).</p>
<p>
You will be involved in the product name, associated branding, technique, sales training and product launch with revenue goals in mind. Because you are result-oriented, you take pride in optimizing profit as well as meeting/exceeding marketing, financial and corporate growth objectives by working across diverse internal and external teams.</p>
<p>
Your business plans focus on attention to long and short range consequences and optimization of both marketing share and profitability of existing and new products. Managing the day-to-day progress of the product, you astutely multitask as you conduct marketing analysis to develop product definitions, coordinate technical product development, estimates of potential profits, and release to production as well as a prioritized list of customer and market requirements for the product.</p>
You realize that your products must prove to be clinically and financially justified so you carefully conduct market research to identify/track market trends, produce competitive analysis/materials to compare like products from our competitors and product selection/definition. Of course, because our customers are at the forefront of our success and the way we do business, you always perform your duties in compliance with applicable FDA and state regulations as well as standards. You are motivated and ready to immerse yourself in this role to become the subject matter expert.<br>
