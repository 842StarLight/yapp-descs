<div>This Business Planning and Operations (BP&amp;O) Director will manage three groups that support Facebook’s Marketing Science, Creative Shop, and Solutions Engineering teams. In FB’s sales organization, these stakeholder groups play a critical role in our go-to-market efforts, enabling sales through robust measurement, creative, and sales engineering specialist support. The BP&amp;O teams mapped to these groups optimize their performance by delivering against three core functions: 1) Core operations (e.g. planning, metrics, and rhythm of business, 2) Strategic initiatives to help accelerate opportunity capture and 3) Organizational enablement through reporting, tools, and process improvement.
<br>
<br>
This Director role is new within the BP&amp;O organization and was created to help drive more coordination across the three teams. As Facebook’s business evolves and complexity increases, having streamlined and efficient deployment of resources is critical. In this position, you will help to ensure that we are marshaling the benefits of scale through things like a coordinated named account list approach, harmonized service levels, and rationalized resource models. In doing this work, besides partnering with stakeholder groups, this director will also interface heavily with colleagues within BP&amp;O that support our direct and scaled sales channels, as well as other cross-functional partners such as Finance and HR.
<br>
<br>
The ideal leader is familiar with the digital advertising industry and has a proven record of driving strategic business decisions by using clear frameworks, deploying excellent communication tactics, producing deep analyses as the foundation upon which recommendations are built, and building and growing sales operations talent and organizations. Additionally, this leader must be passionate about Facebook and be an inspiring leader/manager who can quickly build relationships with people of varying personality types.</div>
