<p>WHO WE ARE:</p>
<p>
Web Canopy Studio works with growing SaaS companies who are overwhelmed and need differentiation in a growing competitive landscape. They are typically frustrated because they can't appropriately gather leads without using traditional marketing methods like advertising, which are time-consuming, expensive, and not sustainable. We help our clients by designing innovative and intuitive websites to increase website conversions, and by fulfilling lead nurturing and marketing needs in an ongoing format.</p>

<p>
