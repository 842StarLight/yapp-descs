<p><b>MANAGE THE CUSTOMER JOURNEY</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Strategic Targeting/Segmentation</b> – This senior Digital leader will be responsible for helping to identify the highest potential customers/personas who offer the greatest delta between CPA and LTV. This work will drive the efficient allocation of Digital Marketing for Direct to Consumer resources in order to effectively and profitably capitalize on these segments and prospects. The Director, Direct to Consumer Marketing will help improve and oversee various analytics and customer dashboards to provide insight into current and future consumer behaviors and motivations, in relevant consumer segments.</li>
<li>

They’ll achieve this by working closely with colleagues, to target the right prospects with a consistent, integrated message, and distributing those messages with a wide range of Digital tools,through multiple Digital and paid Digital Media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Google, etc.). The objective is to stimulate consideration of BioSchwartz, in a vast sea of vitamin and supplement options.</li>
<li>
<b>Generate Traffic and Conversion</b> – Once awareness and consideration are achieved, the Digital team needs to use every Digital tool available to profitably drive high potential customers to a variety of E-commerce landing pages. This traffic flow is critical, and will include guidance to BioSchwartz’s site, Amazon, and other online retailers who specialize in Nutrition and supplements. Work collaboratively with other E-commerce contacts, to optimize the site and shopping experience for customers, maximizing conversion.</li>
<li>
<b>Lead CRM &amp; Loyalty</b> – While not a “subscription business,” per se, BioSchwartz’s products are designed to be an important part of your daily nutrition, and a lifestyle centered on health and wellness. This Digital and Direct to Consumer Marketing leader will help build an actionable customer file for the business, enabling BioSchwartz to engage and activate customers, stimulating repeat purchases, and trial on new branded items.
