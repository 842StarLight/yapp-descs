<h2>Partner Development Manager (Account Executive)</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">HubSpot's Sales Partner Program is expanding! Our team is about to complete its third successful year and we're looking for a new team member in North America to help us accelerate growth in 2020. 2019 has been very high growth for us so far –we grew revenue and our partner community substantially and launched operations in Southeast Asia (in addition to our existing teams in North America and Europe) – but we're still in the early innings and are looking for a team member to build the program further in North America.
<br><br>
In this role, you'll be part of a team that is transforming how we market the entire Partner Program, and this is the first step in transforming from a product-specific program to one that's agnostic. We will be targeting mostly IT consultants, sales consultants, management consultants, customer experience consultants, as well as a minimal amount of potential marketing agencies.
<br><br>
The initial phase for this role will be highly transactional to manage a high volume of applications, leads and opportunities - nice "problem" to have! Given the need to manage about 100 partners in order to close up to 50 deals per month, this role requires a highly organized, focused and fast-paced individual. Beyond the first phase, the successful candidate will be expected to build out the consultative partner side of their portfolio, and by extension close larger, more complex deals.
<br><br>
Candidates should also know that we rely heavily on a touchless acquisition, activation and reselling model. Therefore, Sales Partners accepted into the program often need immediate coaching to sell into their client and prospect base (within the first 1 to 2 weeks). This program operates in an Overlay Model, meaning, we do not directly retire quota. Everything our partners close, is retired by the appropriate territory rep. It is our job to aid in that closed business either with the partner or by facilitating collaboration with the sales org. The ideal candidate for this role will also be capable of consulting partners on how to grow their business (we will coach you on how to do this if you've never done it before) and will have experience coaching prospects and customers on HubSpot tools.
<br><br>
<b>In this role, you'll get to:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate all incoming applications to the Sales Partner Program</li>
<li>Engage those good fit inbound applications and prospect potential good fit potential partners in the database</li>
<li>Encourage and collaborate with new partners in order to get them "activated", which means: (1) Get them to purchase (at least) any Starter product, and (2) Start registering leads they want to work with us</li>
<li>Once the new partners are activated, work with those partners to source and close channel deals either directly or through the direct sales org</li>
<li>Provide general coaching, support, and education for partners to help them grow their business better</li>
<li>As the partners develop, identify the ones who should upgrade into the new "L2 Program"</li>
<li>Meet and exceed monthly quotas – both MRR and Activated Partners</li>
</ul>
<b>We are looking for people who have:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Experience within a sales team that produces and exceeds their goals consistently</li>
<li>Experience in a startup environment, if possible</li>
<li>Evidence that you are a Top Producer (as defined by production results that put you at the top 5% of your peers) and / or, Over Quota / President's Club</li>
<li>Bonus: Experience working with HubSpot Agency Partners, CRM Implementation Companies, CRM Consultants, Sales Coaches, Sales Trainers, Sales Consulting businesses is a bonus</li>
<li>Superior communication skills, both written and verbal, including a strong attention to detail</li>
</ul>
<b>Required Education:</b><br>
