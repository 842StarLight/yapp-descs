<p><b>POSITION: Technology Consultant / Help Desk Coordinator </b></p>
<p>This position involves typical residential computer repairing, and consulting, helping residential clients, and maintaining Windows based workstations - remotely and sometimes on-site. Software troubleshooting skills are also required. Many clients have unique and specialized applications and systems, so the ability to troubleshoot based on the fundamentals of application and network design may be required.</p>
<p>You should have the ability to build the client relationship by discovering new solutions, optimizations and recommendations for items outside the scope of the immediate concern that would help the client have a more reliable, efficient and secure infrastructure. While the rest of your team is always available to assist in troubleshooting issues and working out solutions, you are expected to be able to move projects along with no (or limited) supervision or management. We consider ourselves employees of our clients; we are always professional, ethical and respectful of our client's businesses, staff and owners at all times. Our goal is to provide meaningful solutions to our clients that give them an advantage. We impose no sales goals on our staff but instead allow you the freedom to develop your skills and move your career ahead in an associate based culture.</p>
