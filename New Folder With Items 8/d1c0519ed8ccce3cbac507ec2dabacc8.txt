<h2>Realty Buyer Broker</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p><b>How would your life change if you consistently earned $75,000, $100,000, $150,000 or more as a full-time real estate agent?</b></p>
<p>You don’t have to be a full-time agent to join our team BUT you must have the desire to do what it takes to become successful. We will show you how.</p>
<p>An agent-centric culture. A commitment to training, coaching, and education. A model that rewards our agents as true partners.</p>
<p><b>NOW… We want YOU to become part of our team!</b></p>
<p>However tough it’s been for you, whatever you’ve been through, regardless of how discouraged you may feel right now – I can likely relate to your situation. I created a better way to succeed in real estate and I’ll gladly share with you what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>I’m doing something very special with my business and my team. Agents who will accept and adopt my methods for lead follow-up and fulfillment, client service, and team work will enjoy a high rate of success plain and simple.</p>
<p>In our business, success and a high rate of pay go hand in hand. Nothing in this business stays the same and if you don’t have a systemized businesslike approach, a proven methodology, and support, making a living in real estate in the “new economy” is going to be very hard.</p>
<p><b>This opportunity might be a PERFECT fit for YOU…</b></p>
<p>We’ve recently found ourselves in need of competent, hard working, professional people to come on board with our team and take advantage of our stellar lead generation, conversion and management systems.</p>
<p>If you’re tired of the daily grind, tired of NOT making money, tired of being tired…then take advantage of my offer. Let’s see if we can forge a relationship of mutual benefit. I’m quite sure we can, I’m quite sure together we can accomplish something very important.</p>
<p>There are a number of advantages to you for moving forward on this…let me highlight a few of them here for you:</p>
<p><b>CONSTANT, CONTINUOUS HIGH QUALITY LEADS PROVIDED</b> – My Lead Generation System creates dozens of requests from buyer and seller prospects every day. I’ve developed a succinct method of follow-up and nurture allowing you to systematically create client relationships and the subsequent sales that follow. You’ll receive ongoing training not only from me but from some of the most sought after trainers in the world…</p>
<p><b>HUGELY REDUCED EXPENSES</b> – beyond your cell phone, car, and MLS &amp; Board fees…you’ll have none of the advertising or lead generation expenses you’re faced with now. I’ll even supply you with office space, business cards and other related items…</p>
<p><b>NO ADVERTISING COSTS WHATSOEVER</b> – As Team Leader, I bear all the cost of marketing, advertising, lead generation and contract processing. We put a great deal of technology out there that you’ll be able to take advantage of.</p>
<p><b>FULL TEAM SUPPORT</b> – Instead of trying to be a tightrope specialist or a professional juggler, you’ll work with other members of my team which will enable you to focus solely on your task. We’ll reduce your administrative tasks to get you focused on the tasks that make you money – Prospecting &amp; Lead Follow Up, Signing Buyer Loyalty Agreements, Showing Homes, Writing Offers and Attending Closings (and Cashing Commission Checks!). We’ll handle almost all of the administrative duties, the marketing, all the closing coordination, and much more. You’ll have laser focus on making money…</p>
<p><b>HIGH QUALITY LEADS</b> – The “cold calling” method of lead generation (trading time for money the hard way) has ruined more careers in our industry than any other single prospecting recommendation and we don’t require it. All of the leads we provide have reached out to us asking for information on a specific home or the home buying process in general. Of course this doesn’t mean that we don’t prospect, quite the contrary, we are simply able to focus our time more on prospects that want to speak with us rather than getting hung up on.</p>
<p><b>ALL THE TOOLS &amp; TRAINING YOU NEED TO QUICKLY GET TO THE CLOSING TABLE</b> – Cutting edge technology tools, buyer packet and presentation, and the training to go with them will be given to you so you can begin succeeding immediately. Our training programs will ensure that you stay focused on the activities that will get you productive as quickly as possible. It’s no wonder that real estate agents drop out of the industry, the lack of training and support runs rampant among traditional brokerages and teams, not at The DeGrood Team…</p>
<p>So, if working with a team that has a unique culture and vision, all the tools and training you need to succeed, and if a steady supply of leads and commission generating opportunities interests you, please reach out today.</p>
