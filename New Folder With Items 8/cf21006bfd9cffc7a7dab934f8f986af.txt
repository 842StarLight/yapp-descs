<div>Our Small Business Group (SBG) team contributes directly to Facebook's mission by helping businesses grow and creating jobs. We focus on connecting every small business in the world with their customers on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger and then helping them grow through solutions like pages, advertising, and messaging. We succeed when we help our customers grow their business and create jobs in their communities. Our team is one of only two sales channels responsible for Facebook's multi-billion-dollar advertising business. And we help more than 99% of our advertisers. Our potential business is even larger with more than 70 million active businesses on our platform. We have a unique opportunity to serve one of the largest communities of small businesses in the world. And to make each one of their experiences personalized, we rely on data, insights, and powerful platforms. Thus, we've built a different type of sales team. One that balances technology and people. And one that we hope will blaze new territory for the entire industry.
