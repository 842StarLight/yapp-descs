<b>What We Are About:</b><br>
------------------
<br><br>
Do you believe that art and craft of sales can be practiced as professionally as medicine or law? At Illumio we believe that sales is a noble profession and have set ourselves to the task of becoming great at what we do because the stakes are high. Every day we interact with thought leaders from security, networking, and operations teams who want to learn how to segment their systems in a better way. For our prospects, their reputation in the marketplace, and in many cases, their stock price is tied to how well they maintain the trust of their customers. They work under constant vigilance from their auditors and regulators – careers and reputations are always at stake.
<br><br>
Against this backdrop, we are the conduit for Illumio's substantial expertise and experience in delivering the largest and most successful micro-segmentation deployments in the world. Our prospects need your best communication, organizational, and inter-personal skills to connect them to the information, tools, and resources to assist them on their buyers journey. You will face larger and more established competitors every day. But if you like to win – to lead customers toward a bright future, and exceed their expectations, we will equip you with unique insights, tools, and systems that will help you reach new levels of professional accomplishment.
