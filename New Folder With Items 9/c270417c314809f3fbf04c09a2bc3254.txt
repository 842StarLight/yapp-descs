<div>
<p>The Nashville office of Benchmark International is now looking for business professionals to fill an entry-level role on its sell-side mergers and acquisitions team.</p>
<p>Our analysts begin learning negotiation skills, valuation metrics, and the entire M&amp;A process from their first day on the job. They engage clients and potential acquirers on a daily basis working to generate buyer interest in our clients, negotiate the terms of non-disclosure agreements, and begin the response to the buyer?s due diligence investigation into their team?s portfolio of businesses for sale.</p>
<p>This is a role requiring the ability to hold your own against business owners, private equity associates, and business development professionals from Fortune 500 companies. You will work on multiple files, across a variety of industries, every day. As an entry-level position, you will not be expected to have any particular M&amp;A knowledge but must have a keen interest in growing your knowledge-base in this exciting field of business. All aspects of the company sale process will unfold on the trading floor within easy earshot of your workstation. As you gain experience, your involvement and responsibilities will progress further through the process. As there is more than enough work to go around on our teams, those with the interest and ability will be given additional responsibilities on a case by case basis after first proving their ability to go eye-to-eye with the various constituencies involved in the process and come out with favorable results for our clients.</p>
<p>Client origination, general firm marketing, and similar operational distractions are taken off the teams? plates, keeping to Benchmark International?s model. This allows a more focused approach on operations and portfolio management. The teams? obligations regarding each client commence with a signed engagement letter and detailed file, prepared by the separate Deal Origination Department, and continue through every aspect of the transaction (other than legal and accounting services) to the closing and collection of the resulting success fee.</p>

Company Overview</b></p>
<p>
Benchmark International is one of the world’s leading merger and acquisitions specialists in the sale of mid-market companies. With offices throughout the world, we are in touch with all the major acquirers and consolidators who are constantly seeking both on and off market opportunities across all sectors. Our unique and dynamic international offering presents our clients with unparalleled global coverage, allowing them access through our exclusive databases and business intelligence facilities to both international markets and local representation.</p>
<p>
Our client base consists almost entirely of owners actively involved in businesses they founded decades earlier. At times, multiple family members are involved. Our clients seek either an opportunity to exit their business or the means to ensure its continued future growth. They look to our company to find both an acquirer with the right fit and a transaction that provides maximum value and the correct structure. As a result of the dynamics of this market, our bespoke process has been developed specifically to handle not only the business aspects of these transactions but also their personal and emotional components.</p>
<p>
We handle clients in any industry but a disproportionate share of the Tampa office’s closings has involved companies in the healthcare and software developers’ sectors. Closings have increased year-over-year with over 100 closings company-wide last year and the Tampa office crossing 30 in 2017 for the first time.</p>
<p>
Benchmark International began in the United Kingdom over a decade ago. Our Tampa headquarters opened in 2013 and continues to grow as our domestic client base and international buyer-contacts expand. We ventured into Texas January 2016. 2017 brought office openings in South Africa, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Our Nashville office opened in January 2018.</p>
<p>
We offer our clients a unique business proposition that has resonated well with the US market as it has with markets in other countries. Recognizing that the US M&amp;A markets are the most robust in the world, particularly in this coveted middle-market range, we are planning to expand our US presence in the coming years. Coming onboard now presents you the opportunity to ride this wave of growth. Benchmark International promotes from within, and we look forward to bringing you onboard as the next generation of Benchmark International’s leaders.</p>
