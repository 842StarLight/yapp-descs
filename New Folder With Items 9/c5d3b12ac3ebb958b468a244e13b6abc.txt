<div><b>Contrast Security named to Forbes "Next Billion-Dollar Startups 2019 List"</b></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Contrast Security, Inc. is the world’s leading provider of security technology that enables software applications to protect themselves against cyberattacks. Contrast's patented deep security instrumentation is the breakthrough technology that enables highly accurate analysis and always-on protection of an entire application portfolio, without disruptive scanning or expensive security experts. Only Contrast has intelligent agents that work actively inside applications to prevent data breaches, defeat hackers and secure the entire enterprise from development, to operations, to production.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Everyone at Contrast plays a critical role, and we all want co-workers who want to be here. We’re looking for a unique pedigree in our SE candidates that is ¼ developer, ¼ sysadmin, ¼ consultant, ¼ fierce-competitor.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Problem solving is one of the most important traits we need in our SEs, including the ability to think on our feet. Sure, Contrast is really easy to deploy and work with, but every environment is different. The SE is a key link between Sales, Product Management and Engineering, so you need to be able to synthesize for executives, work with sales reps day-to-day, and communicate with engineers when necessary. Candidates need to have very strong backgrounds and comfort working in Linux and Windows, specifically the CLI and OS services/commands.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
We’ll be honest, the road for an SE is filled with both successes and challenges, with plenty of bumps along the way. If you are a thrill seeker, have a positive outlook (your glass is always half-full), and want to come back to work every day regardless of how things went yesterday, then this might be the right role for you.</div>
