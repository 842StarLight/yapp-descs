Program Overview</b><br>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Acuity's Information Systems and Technology Leadership Program is designed to identify high potential candidates in the fields of Information Systems Management and Computer Science. These candidates join the company in full time professional roles that are designed to enhance their early career development. Each participant spends their first 18-24 months of employment rotating every 6 months in various roles, all located in the greater Atlanta area. These roles are largely designed to allow a wide range of exposure to the IST organization and simultaneously give each part of the organization exposure to the member of the program. The goal of the leadership program is to expose new grads to a variety of paths within a discipline while preparing for a more permanent position after completing 3 – 4 rotations. This allows participants to build their skill sets and find their niche within the company. Leadership Program start dates will be available for December 2019 and May 2020 graduates.</p>
