<br>
Bivium has placed 10+ engineers on this team and have worked with this client for many years....tons of $$$, sales and still growing rapidly. VERY happy engineering group.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
Some great details about our client:<br>
<br>
We continue to grow, both in terms of revenue/client base and staff.<br>
<br>
We presently have about 30 developers working with the Application Development team: total engineering team, across all engineering groups, is probably &gt;100 (it depends on how we count some of the R&amp;D functions we have). The immediate dev team for this role is ~30 though.
<br>
<br>
Our client a positive, growing, great place to work, delivering a product that their clients, and their customers, like/enjoy).
<br>
<br>
This role often extends beyond pure coding (there is some design, some client facing aspects and some analytics for instance) which keeps it interesting.<br>
<br>
The fact that it's client-directed engineering work, and that the typical project is probably 4-6mo in duration, meaning there is significant variety/challenge in the work over time.<br>
<br>
We have a pretty strong history of retaining developer talent (I'd guess our average tenure is &gt;4yrs for this role) which I think speaks to the continued challenge/enjoyment.<br>
<br>
Product is a SAAS model, using a lot of in-house IP and technology, in a growing industry segment, and an area of technology that interests many developers.<br>
<br>
The requirements we currently have open are entry/junior (0-3 years), but I am interested in considering more senior talent also (if we find the right senior candidate I anticipate opening the req will not be an issue). We could hire "3" candidates now.<br>
<br>
In addition to the 'pitch' notes above, I think we office a competitive benefits package and, for many of our employees, the commute to Franklin is a positive vs a city commute.<br>
<br>
For my team we also operate in a 'Flexible Work from Home' modality, once someone has onboarded successfully we have many developers who will work ~3 days a week in the office and the other two remote.<br>
<br>
The most important skills are:<br>
<br>
1.Great Java skills<br>
2.Excellent communication skills<br>
3. Sharp/bright -can quickly ramp up things that are new, without fear.<br>
