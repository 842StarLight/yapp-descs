<h2>Manager, Commercial Sales</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">About ThousandEyes
<br><br>
<b>The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas:</b> the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As organizations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a "black box"; outside of their control. ThousandEyes gives organization's visibility and insight into the now borderless network. It arms them with an accurate understanding of how the network impacts their applications, users and customers. ThousandEyes is central to the global operations of the world's largest and fastest growing brands, including Comcast, eBay, HP, 120+ of the Global 2000, 75+ of the F500, 20 of the top 25 SaaS providers, 6 of the top 7 US banks, 4 of the top 5 UK banks, and 5 of the top 10 companies on the 2018 Forbes Cloud 100 list.
