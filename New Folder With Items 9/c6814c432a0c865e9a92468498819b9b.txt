<h2>Account Director</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>As an Account Director with TrueSense Marketing, you lead a team serving major clients - developing direct response multi-channel fundraising strategies, while meeting client objectives, budgets and revenue goals. You are responsible for maintaining and growing existing client relationships and in some cases responsible for new business development with prospective clients.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, you own the client – and you own the client's relationship with the agency. Therefore each of your responsibilities has an external, client facing element and an internal, team or process oriented element. Your success is dependent on being able to manage both the external and internal elements. You may also be responsible for securing new business in your assigned categories.</p>
<p>
Essential Functions:</p>
<p>
Big Picture Items</p>
<ul>
<li>
Own the client. This means you know the client's story – their "narrative" at all times. What's working – what's not – what their mood is – what their expectations are – what's new for them and what their challenges are. You will be responsible for bringing that narrative to all agency planning sessions for your client.</li>
<li>
Own the client pro forma budget and growth projections. This means that you will be responsible for ensuring that an annual budgetary and projection plan is developed and approved by the client before the year's work begins. The budget is produced in coordination with client involvement and to meet their expectations. And producing this document will involve you receiving input from various departments; such as creative, print/production, digital, media, and analytics.</li>
<li>
Own the client's annual plan. The budget document (above) is one part of the annual plan. The plan is the narrative to the budget – it provides the rationale as to why we're making our recommendations as they are. As with the budget, various departments and team members provide input into that document.</li>
<li>
Own the timely execution of all client projects. This means understanding the internal processes and timelines so that all deliverables are provided to the various departments on time so that the client delivery dates are met.</li>
<li>
Own your reporting relationships – up, down, and across the agency. You are responsible for managing "up" to your supervisor(s) to keep them aware of success – and challenges. You are responsible for communicating and building strong team relationships with your peers and for the junior members of your team. Teamwork is not just wanted – it is required! It is how we accomplish what we do.</li>
<li>
Own the training of junior team members. You are expected to lead and train your team. They need to see you in action and be able to learn from you. This will require frequent meetings and a lot of face time – both structured as well as hallway conversations. Weekly meetings with team members are strongly recommended.</li>
<li>
Own the agency budget expectations for your clients. This means that you are on top of all agency billings and income and changes to the client's annual plan. You are expected to provide projections for the client during each agency planning cycle (August for each coming fiscal year), and be ready to update quarterly projections for the agency Finance department.</li>
<li>
Own the increase in new business in the client verticals you have been assigned. This means working through the "sales cycle" with as many prospects as is possible: introduction, education, proposal, and decision.</li>
<li>
Own achievement of sales goals. Together with agency leadership, you will assess the market, the sales potential, prioritize prospects and create the strategy and tactics for reaching targets.</li>
<li>
Own the creation of proposed plans that solve for each individual prospect's unique business needs. You'll be responsible for gaining insights and recommendations from internal specialists – and assimilating those insights together with the agency's client service model; pricing framework; and prospective clients' goals – to form the proposed client solution. You will own the packaging and delivery of solutions that are right for their needs right now and for where they aspire to be long term.</li>
