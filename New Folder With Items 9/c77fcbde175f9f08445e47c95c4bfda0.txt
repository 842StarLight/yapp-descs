<h2>Inside Sales Representative</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>Onspring is seeking energetic, intelligent, revenue-driven sales professionals who want to be part of a high-growth software company.</p>
<p>
The primary objective of the Inside Sales Representative (ISR) is to identify, qualify and close sales opportunities within our Commercial/Mid-Market space (companies less than $1B in revenue). ISRs engage in conversations with key individuals (typically C-level and VP-level) to determine if they may be a good fit to work with us. After researching potential contacts using sales intelligence and social selling tools, we spend time on calls and web meetings with prospective clients to discover their business challenges, identify their requirements, provide solution demonstrations and, ultimately, help them to justify their decision and buy our software.</p>
<p>
The Inside Sales Representative will report to the VP, Inside Sales and will work in Onspring’s Overland Park, KS office with travel estimated at 0-10%.</p>
