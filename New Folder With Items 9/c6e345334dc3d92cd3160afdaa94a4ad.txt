<h2>Sales Representative/Market Launcher</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>Do you want a role and an employer that appreciates how hard you’re willing to work? Are you sick of capped commissions/changing commission plans and office politics? Do you want to build and launch a sales team?<br>
</p>
<p>
Total compensation has been $90-120K+ for this role, but it requires commitment and hard work. If you achieve it, you will have the opportunity to launch your own market and sales team within 12-18 months.
</p>
<p>AptAmigo's mission is to build trust, one person and one apartment at a time. We've built the best service and technology in a stale, dysfunctional industry and are looking for a highly motivated individual to get in on the ground floor at one of the fastest growing real-estate technology companies out there. If you think you can sell, we pay commission (uncapped). No more arbitrary or capped bonuses! 100% of our hires have successfully placed clients within their first week, with no real estate experience. If you are passionate about real estate, sales, and building relationships, this is the job for you.</p>
