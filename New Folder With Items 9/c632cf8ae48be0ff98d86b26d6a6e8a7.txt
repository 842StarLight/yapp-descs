<h2>Training and Development Coordinator (Back of House Restaurant Operations)</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>Company Introduction:<br>
Curry Up Now started in 2009 with a single food truck roaming the streets of Burlingame. With great success and an amazing team behind us, we’ve since expanded to three food trucks, six brick &amp; mortar restaurants and two craft cocktail bars and have started franchising across the US.<br>
<br>
Even though we have great plans to continually expand in the future, we’re still a small company and will always be a small company at heart. This means our employees aren't a faceless number to us. We cherish each and every employee as they really are the only reason we keep doing what we're doing.<br>
