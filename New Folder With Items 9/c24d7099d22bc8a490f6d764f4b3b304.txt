<h2>Government Contracts Lawyer</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">
<p><b>The Firm </b><br>Reid Law PC advises, represents, and develops entities seeking to establish, protect, or expand their presence in federal markets. As both strategic mentor and outside legal counsel, we guide businesses through the regulatory labyrinth, technical challenges, financial complexities, and myriad legal mandates inherent to transactions and disputes with federal agencies. We have served businesses since 2007 across the nation and around the globe of nearly every size (from start‐ups to multi‐billion dollar giants) and industry sector (e.g., construction, architecture, engineering, manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, telecommunications, information technology, hazardous materials, RDT&amp;E, etc.).</p>
<p><b>The Work </b><br>We are trusted advisers and key stakeholders to federal contractors of every stripe. We advise, counsel, advocate, and protect our clients with regard to proposal development; small business certifications; teaming alliances; joint ventures; mentor‐protégé relationships; subcontractor agreements; size and status challenges; solicitation and award protests; contract negotiations; past performance appeals; cost standards; labor issues; export control; foreign military sales; international arms trafficking compliance; inventions and data rights, contract amendments; equitable adjustments; inspections and warranties; terminations for convenience and default; false claims, fraud, and corruption charges; suspension and debarment actions; and much more. We litigate against federal agencies and commercial entities alike.</p>
<p><b>The Position </b><br>1099 position available immediately. Ideally suited to a professional ready to leave big law, active duty, or civil service and embrace the small law revenue roller coaster vs a fixed salary and benefits for the sake of having a tailored personal life and without having to chase clients to get paid. Strong preference for Guard/Reserve/retired JAG officer or former federal civilian OGC. Need not be exclusive to our team; merely available to engage on behalf our clients as needed. Commitment ranging from a handful of hours per week to a truckload. Hourly rate depends on experience. 50% bonus on all hours for any clients brought or recruited. No relocation required; just able to work virtually and travel as needed.</p>
<p><b>The Candidate </b></p>
<p>The next member of our team must be a seasoned legal practitioner, actively licensed in any jurisdiction and with a clean ethics history, have substantial experience in both transactions and litigation involving all aspects of government contracts, and be passionate about serving small businesses as well as larger entities. Our world is the FAR, DFARS, FMS, ITAR, SBA, CVE, T4D, FCA, GAO, COFC, USDC, and more. We are looking for lawyers fluent with those acronyms and interested in being a hired gun vs. an employee.</p>
<p><b>Summary </b><br>If you enjoy commuting to an office, working prescribed hours, wearing a suit and tie, being micromanaged, and getting paid peanuts regardless of your work, this is the wrong position for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy autonomy, flexible hours, freedom of action, and getting paid based on your effort, this is likely a good match. No intake screening, practice management, or invoice collections required. Just a great hourly rate with prompt payment for superb lawyering… and even more if you make rain.</p>
