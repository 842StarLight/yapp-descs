Head of Commercial VR<br>
Job Description:<br>
Lenovo's Strategy organization within IDG is incubating many new emerging businesses to position for growth into the future. We are looking to hire the Head of Commercial VR reporting directly to the Business Leader. Essentially, we’ve created a startup within the larger Lenovo structure. This role will be part of a large cross-functional team that includes hardware engineering, software development, industrial/mechanical design, UX and global sales. The project and role are critical to transforming Lenovo from a preferred hardware supplier to a Solution-centric, innovation driven strategic partner.<br>
The Head of Commercial VR is a multi-functional role that will wear many hats. The position can be viewed as a mix of VP of Business Development, VP of Product and VP of Sales Engineering in a pre-revenue startup. The team is growing quickly and we need someone to join us from the existing VR community so they can hit the ground running. This is a unique opportunity to help drive this emerging business from the ground up. The role will present ongoing status, results, and recommendations to Director and VP levels. The candidate must be able to "fire-fight" on a daily basis, and boil up to senior management with effective, efficient communication...ultimately, driving concept to tangible products.<br>
The ideal candidate will be based at the US Headquarters in Raleigh, NC. Lenovo is a global company with HQ based in Beijing with customers and partners worldwide therefore candidates are expected to join conferences calls outside of "normal" business hours to help support internal development as well as customer engagement.
