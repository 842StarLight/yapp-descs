<p>Join AWS IoT to build and launch a confidential new service that will connect billions of IoT devices to AWS. We are looking for a Principal Product Manager to own the product end-to-end. This person will work closely with teams across IoT and Lab126 to drive offerings that promises to be a game changer in the connected products arena.<br>
For Amazon, the proliferation of connected devices presents a rare opportunity to establish higher-value, longer-term relationships with our existing cloud customers, and also engage with new classes of customers. The more constrained a device in compute, storage, bandwidth or battery, the more heavily it relies upon other systems to execute logic, communicate with other devices, and record sensor and telemetry data. The aggregate volumes of data will produce substantial new cloud workloads.<br>
As a Principal Product Manager, you will be in charge of the overall strategy of your product, gathering customer feedback and understanding their needs and pain point, you will define the pricing models and work closely with Business Development and Marketing to ensure fast adoption of the product. As this is a technical role, you will also work closely with the Developers and the customer experience team to define the details, specifications and user experience of the product, ensure the path to successful shipping of features and measure adoption over time<br>
<br>
Our early success shows that AWS can become the default platform that powers connected devices and their associated apps and cloud workloads for end-to-end solutions, inclusive of a strong ecosystem of technology partners. We hear from our customers that the complexity of putting together end to end solution is hindering their ability to bring their solutions to market. As a platform, AWS IoT and the rest of AWS services can serve customers and partners needs is multiple way but they need more hand holding and guidance from AWS than with other, more traditional product lines. End-to-end solutions from AWS IoT and partners will remove the existing frictions and complexity manufacturers, app developers and end-customers face when putting together solutions.<br>
