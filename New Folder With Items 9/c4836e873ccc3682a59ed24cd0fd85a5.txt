You will NOT BE SELLING anything â€“ only setting appointments for our outside reps to drop by for a quick 5-15 min presentation to learn about the advertising opportunity. Our kiosks are an amazing, value-added amenity that shoppers are so incredibly grateful for, and advertisers really love - as they are able to place their giant photo on the stand, which faces shoppers entering the store. In other words, you will be selling a highly valuable and coveted product that is new, fresh, and will keep you invigorated because many customers are truly grateful agreeing to a face to face meeting in order to learn more.<br>

We offer extremely competitive pay ($20 per hour in addition to a bonus of $40.00 when reps complete the sales on the appointments that you set up) which should boost your net effective pay to $30 per hour if you are meeting our expectations.</p>
