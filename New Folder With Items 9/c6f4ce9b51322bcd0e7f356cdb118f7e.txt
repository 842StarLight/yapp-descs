<p>AWS enables companies of all sizes to rethink technology.<br>
Our team focuses on enabling our enterprise customers to provide secure desktop experience, as well as access to legacy corporate apps to their end users on any device, anywhere. We enable architecture, design, and engineering firms access to graphics-intensive applications on any device, anywhere. And we allow our ISV partners to turn their existing apps into Software as a Service without any rearchitecting.<br>
<br>
If you are excited by these opportunities to unshackle customers from traditional desktops and have relevant experience, please come join our team and let's cloudify the world!<br>
<br>
After joining our team, you will be provided with two months of ramp-up and a team of mentors to ensure you get off to a good start. After that, within the first six months, we will ask you to help your first 2-3 major customers move their desktops/apps to the cloud. Within first 12 months, you will have an opportunity to work with at least a dozen major US companies, conduct internal training, and publish blogs and whitepapers.<br>
You will also have an opportunity to influence the direction of our products by providing actionable customer feedback to the product and engineering managers.<br>
<br>
At AWS, customer obsession is in our DNA. In order to be successful in this role, you will need to become a trusted advisor to our customers and to partner with AWS sales, business development, and generalist solutions architecture to develop the internal expertise needed to help even larger number of customers realize the benefits of cloud-based virtual desktops and applications.<br>
<br>
You will be part of a great team of very supportive people who will help you be successful, but also expect a lot of you. This role is not for everyone - we are looking for people who are self-driven, willing to take ownership of things and see them through, able to earn trust of our customers and their colleagues by consistently delivering on their commitments. And, above all, we are looking for people who share our customer obsession.<br>
<br>
This is a customer facing role. You will be required to travel to client locations and deliver professional services when needed.<br>
<br>
If you want to be part of a once in a lifetime transformation in the IT industry and achieve more than you may think you are capable of - this is a perfect place for you!</p>
