<p>About Bondlink</p>
<p>BondLink provides a SaaS platform to bond issuers in the $4 trillion municipal bond industry. We have recently raised a large Series A, we have strong revenue growth, and we are already working with many of the largest issuers in the country.</p>
<p>While our product is finance focused, make no mistakes; internally we are a genuine tech-first startup culture.</p>
<p>Our co-founders include a serial tech entrepreneur with multiple successes and a senior ex-government official with deep experience in the wheelhouse of our product offering.</p>
<p>Culturally we provide all the startup bells and whistles, and we have a beautiful new office in Fort Point that we're looking to fill with talented people.</p>
