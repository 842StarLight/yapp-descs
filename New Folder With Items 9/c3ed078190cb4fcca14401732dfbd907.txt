<h2>Dispatcher / Trip Scheduler</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p><b>Company Core Values. </b>Our mission is to bring kindness to the human race. Our focus is caring for the elderly and the infirm nationwide. Our service is door-to-door (not curb-to-curb). Our drivers meet clients at their front door, drive them to a destination, and accompany them as needed (shopping, medical office, etc.). If you don’t have a passion for helping people, Envoy is not the company for you.</p>
