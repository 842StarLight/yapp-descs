 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>Job Responsabilities:
<p>Founded in 1980, Rentex is one of the largest and most established providers of audio visual, computer, and production rental equipment in the nation. We supply many of the nation’s largest companies with complete audio visual and computer rental equipment and services. Each Rentex warehouse contains a large inventory of high-quality, name-brand, and reliable audio visual &amp; computer rental equipment. We have offices across the US and we are growing!</p>
<br>

<p>
Our reputation rides on every piece of equipment that leaves our warehouses. For that reason, we rely on our quality-control technicians to spot issues and prevent problems. The QC department checks functionality and cosmetic condition on rental equipment, updates software and maintains rental equipment, coordinates or performs repairs, pulls and preps equipment for orders, and provides technical support to sales and users.</p>

But, this role is not for everyone. We work in a warehouse…so it is warm in the summer. Things move fast here. You’ll be expected to follow the directions of our management team and lead technicians, stick to our procedures and stay focused. You’ll need to be a quick-learner and take initiative and responsibility. Everyone here works a few weekends weekend per month. Our best team members arrive early, stay until we’re done, clean up after themselves, and stand by their work.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>
Previous audio-visual experience is required in the discipline of video and cameras. Rentex provides benefits that include medical coverage, PTO, and retirement plans. Our shop is not near public transit, so you must have your own reliable transportation. We want to hear from you if you’re detail oriented, punctual and ready to step-up.</p>
<br>

Additional consideration will be given to those candidates who:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Have basic knowledge in set-up, operation, and troubleshooting of audio visual equipment outside the realm of video.</li>
