<h2>Business Development Manager</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<p>The Business Development Manager is charged with growing the facility-generated earned revenues that are a crucial source of support for Starfinder’s mission and programs. Starfinder’s facility, which includes a newly-renovated 28,000 square foot indoor turf field, is a home base for its soccer and education programs and a second home to many of the youth we serve. Currently, earned income operations take place during non-program hours.
</p>
<p>The ideal candidate for this position is a social entrepreneur: he/she has experience in business development and wishes to put their business acumen to work for a good cause. Every dollar of earned revenue generated by this position will contribute to creating and sustaining high-quality youth programs. If you are inspired by soccer for social change, and are motivated to help us expand opportunities for Philadelphia youth, then you may be a good fit. There is significant opportunity for growth in this role, as Starfinder’s facility has yet to achieve its full income-generating potential.</p>
<p>Strong candidates will be able to demonstrate that they are proactive, efficient, and can deliver results.</p>
<p>Currently, the majority of Starfinder’s earned income is generated by field rentals, pick up soccer, and birthday parties. We believe there is tremendous potential to both expand these uses and to develop new activities, events, and programs to fill underutilized field time.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate will be a strategic thinker with entrepreneurial instincts and a track record of achieving ambitious revenue goals. They will be inspired by the opportunity to grow Starfinder’s existing earned income streams into a more diverse portfolio of activities that are fully integrated with our social impact brand.
</p>
<p>The Business Development Manager will join a staff team that is passionate about Starfinder’s mission, strives for excellence in their work, and loves to laugh (and eat) together. All major events require an “all hands on deck” approach.</p>
<p><b>Starfinder's mission requires that our staff interact with and understand a broad array of cultures, backgrounds, and orientations. We value having a talented team that reflects the population we serve, who come from diverse backgrounds and traditions, and vary by race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, culture, religion, and abilities. We encourage individuals to apply who are eager to contribute to a positive, inclusive, participatory learning environment and help reinforce an atmosphere of mutual respect.</b></p>
<p><b>About Starfinder:</b></p>
