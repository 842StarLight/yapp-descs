About the program</b></p>
<p>
Our MBA Internship Program is a paid internship that will immerse you into the tech industry on a high-impact team. You’ll enhance your skill set, be challenged with rigorous work, grow your network and drive meaningful change in our business.</p>
<p>Outside of your core work, you will participate in a high-touch program that exposes you to Google’s business operations, connects you with interns and Googlers, and invests in your personal and professional development. You may pick up a new technical skill, while also building a relationship with a 1:1 mentor and hearing from company leadership through an exclusive speaker series.</p>
<p>Interns will be considered for potential full-time opportunities in their host organizations based on their internship performance.</p>
<p>MBA interns are placed in teams across the business according to their background and interests. Learn more about our fields of work. Here are just a few teams that interns have joined in the past:</p>
<br>
<p><b>Strategy &amp; Operations:</b> Deliver the analytical insights our leaders use to enable us to innovate. Whether it’s identifying acquisitions and investments, monetizing strategies for products, or developing partners in emerging markets such as Africa and India, Business Strategy Googlers anticipate opportunities and execute programs critical to Google’s short- and long-term growth.</p>
<p><b>Finance:</b> Fuel our moonshots by devising innovative solutions to complex problems in forecasting, accounting, compliance, and project management. From advising our product teams to managing day-to-day balance sheets, you’ll help keep our business on track to meet (or, better yet, exceed) our goals.</p>
<p><b>Google Cloud:</b> Google Cloud helps millions of employees and organizations empower their employees, serve their customers, and build what’s next for their business — all with technology built in the cloud. Our products are engineered for security, reliability and scalability, running the full stack from infrastructure to applications to devices and hardware. And our teams are dedicated to helping our customers — developers, small and large businesses, educational institutions and government agencies — see the benefits of our technology come to life.</p>
<p><b>gTech:</b> Google creates products and services that make the world a better place, and gTech’s role is to help bring them to life. Our teams of solution-oriented trusted advisors support millions of customers globally. Our solutions are rooted in our technical skill, product expertise, and a thorough understanding of our customers’ complex needs. Whether the answer is a bespoke solution to solve a unique problem, or a new tool that can scale across Google, everything we do aims to ensure our customers benefit from the full potential of Google products.</p>
<p><b>Devices &amp; Services:</b> Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Devices &amp; Services team combines the best of Google AI, Software, and Hardware to create radically helpful experiences for users. We research, design, and develop new technologies and hardware to make our user's interaction with computing faster, seamless, and more powerful. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, the Devices &amp; Services team is making people's lives better through technology.</p>
<p><b>People Operations (POps):</b> Keep Google going and growing. Our People Operations team (known elsewhere as HR) and administrative staff are the curious and creative colleagues that anchor us to our foundations and help us shoot for the moon. The POps team lives by the mantra "find them, grow them, keep them," and is dedicated to staffing, development, and a distinct and inclusive culture. Not just coworkers, we're proud Google colleagues who help our company thrive.</p>
<p><b>Product Management:</b> Google aims to build products that organize the world's information and make it universally accessible to our users. As a Product Manager at Google, you could be working on new technologies, platforms, consumer facing products, and/or enterprise systems. The end goal will be to match you with the team that best aligns with your interests, experience, and where you will have the most impact.</p>
<p><b>Sales, Services and Support:</b> Turn product innovations into vital client solutions. The backbone of Google’s success, the account managers, consultants and analysts in these roles are all dedicated to top-notch client service.
