<h2>DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER PACKAGING</h2> 
 <div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div>
<b>Duties and Responsibilities (Key Deliverables):</b><br>
<br>
1. Under supervision, design and develop package or sterilization case components for new or existing products.<br>
2. Participate on project teams to define the design input requirements for medical-device packaging or sterilization case components through consultation with end users and other stakeholders (e.g., nurses, Sales, Marketing, Development, Quality, Manufacturing and Distribution personnel). These design inputs should take into consideration function, reliability, cost and company image.<br>
3. Prepare specifications for the raw materials, components and processes for medical-device packaging or sterilization case components.<br>
4. (For Packaging Engineer) Define and execute test protocols for medical-device packaging or sterilization cases components.<br>
5. (For Case Engineer) Perform cleaning and sterilization assessments of new and modified instruments, nonsterile implants, and/or sterilization cases.<br>
6. (For Case Engineer) Working with an outside laboratory, develop and coordinate cleaning and/or sterilization testing as needed for instruments, implants, and sterilization case systems.<br>
7. (For Packaging Engineer) Define and document sterile product bills of material and shelf life.<br>
8. Establish appropriate project plan (i.e. define tasks, dependencies, schedule and resource requirements).<br>
9. Complete all Design Control activities for projects as required.<br>
10. Under supervision, manage several projects simultaneously.<br>
11. Maintain and improve existing packaging or sterilization case systems.<br>
12. Apply sound engineering problem-solving techniques to package/case development and maintenance tasks including design, statistical analysis, material selection, inspection requirements and manufacturing process requirements.<br>
13. Prepare and submit written and oral communications that describe package/case design concepts, attributes and performance and project status. Areas of involvement include regulatory submissions, Design History Files, package/case evaluation, package/case validation and testing, manufacturing or supplier support, quality control and complaint evaluation.<br>
14. Consult with vendors, as required, regarding the technical aspects of design and development projects.<br>
15. Lead the project team of one major and several minor projects.<br>
16. Assure timely and effective project completion according to the project plan and budget.<br>
17. Review designs for feasibility and accuracy.<br>
18. Approve drawings and specifications.<br>
19. Procure and evaluate prototypes.<br>
20. Assist in the resolution of manufacturing- or quality-related issues.<br>
21. Study and recommend improvements to existing packaging and processes or case systems. This entails staying “up to date” on emerging material and sterilization technologies. This may be accomplished by attending seminars, classes and industry meetings.<br>
22. Perform package/case evaluations.<br>
23. Participate in the establishment of goals, project plans and resource requirements.<br>
24. Identify, analyze and recommend new technologies or materials for specific applications.<br>
25. Define and execute product testing and validation protocols.<br>
26. Recommend project priorities based on perceived market needs.<br>
27. Contribute to the timely and accurate completion of the projects and tasks assigned to his/her team.<br>
28. Know and apply the Quality System and any appropriate Federal and International standards.<br>
29. Assist and support other employees, teams, and sales personnel as necessary.<br>
